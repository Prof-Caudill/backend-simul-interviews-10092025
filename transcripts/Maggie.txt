I: Okay. And what was that?

P: A good life or whatever but it didn't work.

I: Um hum [positive].  So you were doing it for the kids.

P: Yeah.

I: Would you describe yourself as an active parent in their lives now?

P: No cause I haven't seen them.

I: Have you talked to them?

P: They, they write me and I write them once, I'm allowed to see them once, I mean not see them but write them like a certain, cause it was hard on, it was hard on my kids or whatever. They so they told me I couldn't see them.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: So it was cause they ripped them off my legs and stuff so we were attached. Me and my kids were like this, pretty close.

I: Do you think they were old enough to remember everything that happened?

P: My oldest, not my oldest but my middle son, he you know he's like, "Well can you explain?" you know and it's hard to go into it cause he's still young, you know.

I: Cause you guys were friends right?

P: Were. Um hum [positive]. 

I: Okay, Um. How, how often do you think you are able to write each other?

P: They're, now that they're getting older cause when I got out of prison they, a lawyer came and you know wrote up papers and got out some application thing that you know when they reach a certain age, like 15 or whatever...

I: Um hum [positive].

P: ...It's their decision whether they want you know cause really I didn't get a chance to get them back you know because of him you know.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: So when there, you know they reach they fact that they wanna start knowing me or whatever and they want to come see me, they can.

I: Right. 

P: But my, they write me like twice a year. That's, that's the legal, you know what I mean. That's all I can do.

I: Oh, okay. 

P: Cause we don't want to push it.

I: Right. Okay, so you're waiting until they're 15.

P: Um hum [positive].

P: [Shakes head no]

I: Okay. Um, okay now I'm going to try to understand your incarceration history. You were, the three years, got out in?

P: I don't remember. Probably, I think it was 2003.

I: 2003. 

P: Um hum [positive].

I: Okay. And then?

P: Pretty much I was like, I didn't have any kids so I pretty much didn't care, pretty much.

I: Didn't care.

P: Back to the same thing.

I: Back to the streets?

P: Um hum [positive].

I: Did you go back to your babies dad at this point?

P: [Shakes head no]

I: No. 

P: Never a gain.

I: Is it all a blur?

P: No it's done.

I: No is this, so 2003.

P: [Interjecting] I try to block it out, yeah, I do. 

I: Did you have a job at this point? Just on the streets? When did you get in trouble again? Or did you?

P: Well, lets see I started selling drugs again and then we were getting an apartment and this girl that was living there all her stuff was there and then we went out. I'm not saying I was clean, cause I wasn't you know...

I: Um hum [positive].

P: ...we got raided and um her pills was there or whatever and [inaudible, 35:30].

I: And what were your charges?

P: Possession of a controlled substance.

I: And did you go to prison?

P: No, I just went to jail.

I: Jail.

P: I was in there for a month and a half, they sentenced me to 18. Wait, wait, wait, I was in there for a month the first time and then they put me on Prop 36, I didn't complete it and then so pretty much a violation of probation and so then they sentence me, gave me 18 months with half...

I: Um hum [positive].

P: And then that's when I got on ACS.

I: What was your violation?

P: Uh for, not going to doing my probation and stuff.

I: Oh okay, you just didn't show up.  And then what?

P: Now I'm here [chuckles]. I actually feel better though now.

I: Yeah.  Why is that?

P: Cause I'm clean and like, like some of these officers over here, like my officer and stuff like they actually care.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: When I first came in here they were like. I thought they were just you know like something and then they were like, "You know, if you really want it, you know, we, we can help you." And I thought they were just like, cause of what happened or whatever when they took my kids. They're really here to help you, not just here just because you're criminal or whatever.

I: Right. And how, how do you feel that this is different from Prop 36? The way you were treated?

P: Prop 36 they didn't really want to work, work with me, they didn't want me to get a job, you know what I mean.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: They didn't want to help me actually see they just wanted me to, I don't know it was just a set up for me for failure you know.

I: Um hum [positive]. And how long have you been clean.

P: Umm, I've only been clean for almost two months. 

I: Okay. Good.

P: Um hum [positive].

I: Um is there an event in your life that made you decide, why now?

P: I'm just tired and I have nothing to show for no, nothing that I sold all these drugs you know, you get all this money, I have nothing to show for none of it. 

I: Um hum [positive]

P: And it's time for me to grow up and my kids are almost at that age to where I need, I need to grow up myself.

I: Okay. Um, I'm going to go back to your incarceration.  Um, when you were incarcerated, um, what was your social environment like?

P: I hate living with women. I hate living with women.

I: [Laughing] I couldn't do it.

P: 16 women and, and I'm not a social person because I can't—, I have a big mouth.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: And um, I just can't take, I just can't take it.

I: Right. So what did you find yourself doing?

P: [chuckles]. What do you mean?

I: Dur—, during the day. Did you keep to yourself? Were you...?

P: [Interjecting]. No, I kept making them move me away from out of the different pods cause I couldn't stand them. Instead of just beating somebody up you know what I mean, what I probably would have done, you know what I mean. I took a, a different way and just said you know, I can't be in here, otherwise I'm gonna get in trouble. I'm gonna catch another case.

I: And did they move you no problem?

P: Yup.

I: Okay. When did it hit you were going to be separated from your children?

P: When they told me on the phone that um, your kids can't go there because of him.

I: And was this when, while you were incarcerated?

P: No, this is before.

I: Before.

P: Um hum [positive].

I: did you ever try, were you able to have a conversation with them?

P: It was hard on my kids.

I: yeah.

P: Cause every time they would leave and go back home or whatever when they did get a visitation, they like acted out, you know.

I: Okay. So, they did get visitations.

P: Yeah. 

I: Before you were incarcerated.

P: Yeah when I was trying to get them back and then they said I couldn't cause he busted the windows out.

I: Oh, okay. So this was after the three years?

P: [Shakes head no]

I: No? Before?

P: Um hum [positive]. They terminated my rights before I went to prison. 

I: Okay. How, do you remember how long before?

P: It wasn't even a couple months before I went to prison.

I: Okay. So do you, there was not much time for visitations.

P: Um hum [positive].

I: Okay. Did you have to have, or I guess did you have a plan, or did you know, did you have an idea while you were incarcerated about what you were going to try to do to get your kids back?

P: I already knew you know. They already told me straight out. And then the lawyer had already come to the prison and told me that, "Look, the only way you are going to be able to see your kids or whatever, your gonna have to wait it out until their at this age and then you're going to have to work it out then." And that was the only way.

I: Okay. And did, how, how did that make you feel emotionally while you were incarcerated?

P: Well, I still started doing drugs so honestly.

I: In jail? Or prison?

P: Well there too, yeah.

I: um hum [positive]. 

P: The only thing that helped block it out, you know. 

I: So you blocked it out?

P: Um hum [positive].

I: Why?

P: Cause it hurts. I feel like I failed my kids.

I: Um hum [positive].  Okay.

P: And it's my fault cause I didn't get rid of the idiot. Like my mom did you know, she kept him there for a long time so I kinda repeated the pattern pretty much. 

I: Grew up taking the blame so  you...

P: Um hum [positive].

I: ...now you continue to, to take fault.

P: Um hum [positive].

I: Was there anything in prison that was offered like a parenting program that you were able to take?

P: No.

I: No. Or any options, any other...

P: When I got out of prison and they put me on parole I had to do a parenting class.

I: Okay. And did you have any hope that you could get past this 15 year old you know..

P: Well right now I'm, I'm, I got a pretty good head on my shoulders, you know.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: Pretty sure you know what I mean, I'm just going to have to deal with it. My kids know that I love 'em, that I love them, you know.

I: Um hum [positive].  Okay. Are they able to call you if they want to?

P: They keep in contact, we write and stuff, you know.

I: But they don't, they can't call?

P: Eh uh [negative].

I: Okay. Do you feel that a parenting program would have been beneficial to you while you were inside, in prison?

P: [pause] I have no idea.

I: No? Or any other program to kind of help you in dealing with being away from your kids?

P: I have no idea, honestly.

I: No? Okay. How did you feel about the parenting class while you were on parole?

P: I did two weeks of it so I don't know.

I: Did you learn anything?

P: It kinda made me more madder, honestly.

I: Cause you didn't have your kids.

P: Yeah, they didn't wanna like listen to what I have to say. They just.

I: And what was their justification in enrolling you in this class? Did, did you, were you under the impression that you would get them back or that you would get to see them ?

P: No it was just uh, something that they wanted me to do.

I: Okay.  Are you currently active in parenting down here?

P: No, not yet?
I: No.

P: Eh uh [negative].

I: Do you plan on it?

P: Um hum [positive].

I: Okay. Would you say that you are parenting now?

P: What do you mean?

I: That you are a parent to your children now?

P: [shakes head no]

I: No.

P: They're not here so, no.

I: What, what is your relationship like with your children right now? Do you feel like...?

P: It's distance so you know, they're, they're somewhere that I'm not and..

I: Where do they live? Do you know?

P: Salinas.

I: Salinas. Okay.  What would be your ideal relationship with them?

P: Confusing probly. They don't really know everything and I can't really go into it until I see them face to face. 

I: Um hum [positive].

P: They don't know a whole lot, they were young.

I: Once, so once they all are, turn fifteen, were do you envision your relationship going?

P: We just gotta start off slow, I can't be pushing it, you know.

I: Um hum [positive]. Ten years down the road, were do you see your relationship with your children?

P: Hopefully having one actually, you know. 

I: What kind of relationship?

P: I have no idea honestly. However it goes it goes, I can't predict what's going to happen.

I: Um hum [positive].  You haven't had any sort of vision on what you would want?

P: I can't, I can't you know what I mean, take all these years back and you know cause I missed a lot you know, so I can't just try to be their mother because I haven't been.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: So I gotta you know, you start off you know, slowly trying to work my way up there. I can't, I can't take some thing that I haven't you know what I mean?

I: Um hum [positive]. And what, what slow steps do you think you could take?

P: Just having and being there for them you know. Just trying to be there for them at least you know to work my way up there.

I: Um hum [positive]. How much longer of January 2014.

P: 18th, yeah.

I: Okay. Short.

P: Yeah but, I think it's helping me though.

I: You like it?

P: Um hum [positive].

I: Okay. 

P: [Yawns].

I: Would you say your kids are better off now?

P: No because I can't help them right now. I can't help them until I help myself.

I: Um hum [positive].  Do you ever think, "What if I wasn't the one that went to prison?"

P: I don't know, I can't, I can't really say. I can only wish things, you know what I mean. I can't [inaudible 46:20] like that, you know.

I: Um hum [positive]. Trying not to do that to yourself.

P: Um hum [positive].

I: Trying to look forward.

P: Cause that, that all tears me, that just makes me wanna go relapse.

I: Okay. We all take on different roles um you know, daughter, student, employee. What do you think your biggest role is right now? Or your most important role, in life?

P: Actually do something for myself and try to be somebody instead of just this stupid idiot off the street pretty much.  I'm getting my ged now so.

P:...x, y, and z. I don't know none of that crap.

I: Math.

P: That's like a, a numbers, uh letters of the alphabet to me, you know. So it's kinda hard you know, and I done a lot of drugs so. Kinda, my brains kinda not there no more. [chuckles].  It's slowly coming you know what I mean. But it's gonna take some time and it really makes me mad that I can't, I don't understand it cause I can't comprehend something cause, cause of what I've done to myself.

I: Um hum [positive].  Is it all online or do you do it?

P: [Shakes head yes].

I: Yeah. Is it difficult on the computer?

P: Umm, like I said I have problems comprehending things.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: And like if I read something I can't even remember what I read like not even two seconds later.

I:What's your plan for yourself?

P: Gonna get my ged. I'm trying to go to college, try to better myself and try to actually be somebody instead of just somebody on the street.

I: What's, what's your dream? What do you want to do?

P: I don't know yet.

I: Are you staying here?

P: I mean I have to here I mean cause I have contact through, with my kids through my mom, you know. But I need to, um but once I, you know what I mean, I'm at that point until I'm ready to go and be on my own, you know.

I: Um hum [positive].  So your mom has contact with your kids.

P: Um hum [positive].

I: How does that make you feel?

P: Makes me feel good because my mom's actually, my mom's a big, a big part of my life right now.

P: Just the, it's the same time or whatever she receives the pictures and stuff and their sent to me, you know. 

I: Oh, okay. 

P: Like that.

I: So, it's her mailing address.

P: They don't want me you know what I mean because they don't know what I'm going to write or whatever cause they don't know that I'm clean you know what I mean. They, I have to prove to them that you know, which is understandable.

I: Um hum [positive]. And um, okay. Do, do you feel like there is any , or what, what do you feel like you have to prove? Do you just have to wait till they're 15 that you're clean?

P: Well, yeah but I, but I, they have to see it you know what I mean, without me getting in t—, you know what I mean. And, and with out me doing, if they don't see me doing nothing that's not gonna, you know...

I: Um hum [positive].

P: Which I understand and agree totally because I wouldn't want, you know what I mean. Me getting hight and stuff that does't, that'll never work. That's not no something I wanna be doing with my kids with when they turn this age you know, I want to be somebody who tried to do something so they can see that I actually am trying.


I: Um hum [positive].  What, what do their foster parents tell them about you?

P: [yawns]. They don't, they're not mean you know what I mean. They're working with those, you know. So they're not, they're not like all out to get me which is a lot of them, I'm not gonna lie are, you know in my book you know.

I: Um hum [positive].

But, that's how I see it.

I: Um hum [positive]. Cause they're, they're really good people and they're, they're willing to work. They know who their mother is you know, they let them know you know what I mean, what's going on with me, how I'm doing and stuff so.

I: So they knew that you were incarcerated.

P: Um hum [positive].

I: Okay. And how, how does that make you feel that they know.

P: I, I, I have my mom let them know. 

I: Um hum [positive].

P: I don't lie to them, you know what I mean cause they're gonna find out anyways and I'm not gonna try to manipulate them. I'm not gonna try to lie to them cause it's not gonna, it's not gonna help you know what I mean. They're willing to work with me with this so why should, I, I need to give them at least that.

I: Right. Do you feel like you are able to parent them at all through your letters or through your mothers letters?

P: I'm not tryin' to parent them, honestly.

I: No. Just, "How's it going?"

P: I'm just trying to let them know, you know. I'm not gonna give up on them or whatever.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: But right now, you know. I can't changed what happened or whatever but they are in a good place right now and....

I: That's good.

P: ...that's all that matters.

I: You're doing you. 

P: Um hum [positive].  I need to work on myself, I have lot's to work on. 

I: Um hum [positive].  It sounds like you're off to a good start, a strong start. Um, how has your view of yourself—, I'm not sure if I've already asked this, How has your view of your view of yourself changed since you were first incarcerated?

P: I'm not completely changed at all right now. Cause it's too, it's too short of a time, you know what I mean. It was the same when I went to jail. Well actually when I was clean and sober you know what I mean so I don't know how I can explain that. 

I: Cause you were clean for a while.

P: Um hum [positive].

I: How long were you clean for?

P: Almost eight months.

I: Eight months, okay. And um, what is it that sparked you to start using again?

P: I guess when I got out of prison I just knew that they're never coming home so, you know. 

I: Right. 

P: What's the point I got nothing else to lose.

I: Okay, okay. Um, so you don't, do you see yourself differently?

P: I do. I'm not completely perfect, you know what I mean. I've far from it and I have a lot to work on from myself.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: And I know that I'm changing you know what I mean because I'm, I'm giving the willingness to ever try to do this you know so.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: And before it wouldn't even happen. You couldn't even tell me something.

I: What was your attitude?

P: I didn't give a fuck. That's the truth. 

I: You shut down.

P: Um hum [positive].

I: Are there any questions that you think I should be asking?

P: [chuckling]  You pretty much covered it all.

I: Okay. So we're, we're trying to look at, [pause]... What were you expecting me to ask?

P: Covered it all. 

I: Covered it all.

P: Yeah.

I: And then what made you decide to go ahead with the interview?

P: I needed to talk to somebody about it, I haven't talked about it in a long time.

I: How does it feel talking about it?

P: It makes me feel better.

I: Good, good. I, we may have some other questions come up in other interviews, can we contact you...

P: Um yum [positive].

I:...if that is the case?  Okay um, and we'll just get in touch through Sarah or through your officer or something.

P: That's fine.

I: Any last comments? Okay I'm just going to do a little debriefing. Um, I'm not a therapist but I want you to know that if our conversation has brought up any feelings um you know, it feels good to share our story...

P: Um hum [positive].

I:..no matter what it is, or who you are um, and if you want to talk with a counselor, Sarah and Kendall are there to talk you or to lead you in the direction of um, resources, and if you want to um, you can request that to them in a follow up session.
