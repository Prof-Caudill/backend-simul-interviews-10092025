P: Yeah.

I: Okay.

P: Yeah.

I: Alright, um, and so did you. How long did you live with your grandmother?

P: Oh uh, shoot, until recently we've. It's pretty much been our safe haven, you know?  I did a lot of prison time so I get out of prison and go live with her.

I: Okay so that's still the, that's still what you'd call home?

P: Yeah. Well, well my mom's been clean 20 years cause she (Inaudible). When I get out I go to my grandma's and my mom's had guardianship of my kids since they were little. Cause I'm always in prison.

I: Is it Christian based?

P: Yeah, yeah, just a regular uh, [snaps fingers] Protestant.

I:Protestant?

P: Protestant, yeah.

I: Okay, alright. 

P:  (Inaudible, 0:04:43)

I: I know. 

P: [Laughs]

I: I uh, I uh, yeah.  How would you characterize discipline and self accountability in your household growing up?

P: Um, not too much discipline.

I: No?

P: No. I have uh, I was the oldest. Got two uh, two twin brothers two years younger than me and then a sister that's five years younger. But like I said my mom was in her addiction so we pretty much got to do what we want.

I: Okay so your, as far as your grandmothers discipline that was something that was pretty much...

P: Yeah, she just pretty much took care of the bills and made sure we had food but.

I: Okay.

P: Yeah, we pretty much did what we want.

I: Okay, alright. And so the the, the, the concept of self accountability being responsible for oneself, how would you describe that? I mean,

P: Um, like uh [sigh].  So what's your question? 

I: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

P: Like uh, like uh, like self accountability. Like uh, like taking care of ourselves kinda? Is that kinda?

I: Well, I guess you could look at it from that perspective, from a couple different perspectives.  One would be you know from a disciplinary perspective and you know your responsible for your own behaviors and therefore you get consequences for that. The other side of it could be uh, the self accountability of that independence. Cause you talked about it was kind of, grandma took care of making sure we had a roof over our heads and fed us and things like that but we had a lot of responsibility on us for other things, right?

P: Well uh, I started using drugs at a young age. I started stealing my mom's drugs when I was 13 so.

I: Okay. 

P: Yeah so, pretty much since I was you know just starting my teens I was uh, was on drugs so.

I: What kind of drugs were, did you start off with?

P: Meth.

I: Meth.

P: Yeah.

I: You started off with meth?

P: Yeah.

I:Okay.

P: Well yeah the all, but, drinkin', smokin' weed and meth, all.

I: Okay.  Um, I want to talk a little bit about your early childhood. And so, i'll start out kind of generally. How would you describe it? Happy, sad, lonely?

P: Um, it was, I guess it was alright. You know I uh, like I said my mom was doin' drugs and doin' her thing but uh, it was uh, I had my brothers and my sister and we kind of uh, we had bikes and we had a lot of room to ride and all that. So we, we, we had fun.

I: Okay.

P: We, we did our thing.

I: Okay. And you, and so, Who would you say raised you? Your grandmother or your mom?

P: Um, kinda both like I said my grandmother she, my grandmother took care of the bills and made sure we had food and all that but you know, my mom was around she was just doing, she was just using drugs, she, she was there too but, yeah so, both of them.

I: Okay. Um, and you said had a twin brother and a sister. Is that correct?

P: I got, I got, I got uh, two brothers are twins

I: Oh, twin brothers.

P: Yeah. Their two years younger and then a five year younger sister.

I: So you're the oldest. And so um how, what's the age difference between, or what are your twin brothers names?

P: Uh, Jeremy and Jesse

I: And how old, what's the age difference between you and Jeremy and Jesse?

P: Two years.

I: Two years. And then your sister?

P: Five years.

I: Okay. I'm just going to write their names down here so when I refer back to them I don't, I get it right.

P My sister's name is Taneya. T-a-n-e-y-a.

I: Taneya, okay. Alright and she's five years younger than you are?

P:Yeah.

I: Okay, so, alright. So in a span of five years it was you, your twin brothers, uh Jeremy and Jesse and then Taneya?

P: Yeah.

I: Okay, alright. So we've already established that you were the oldest.

P: Yeah.

I: Okay, and um. What particular challenged did your, did your mom and your grandmother face when raising you and your siblings? Uh like so were there uh, so was money ever, was money ever an issue or legal problems? Anything like that?

P: Uh like. My brother Jeremy he got in trouble a lot when he was younger. He did like juvenile hall and stuff like that so that was.Their challenge with him. And uh, course uh money was an issue uh, back in junior high I was kind of preppy and uh was kinda like wanted expensive clothes and all that, well I didn't really have it or nothin'.  Basketball team and stuff and uh when it was her turn to give us a ride she'd have us all in a ratty van and stuff so that was kind of an issue you know.

I: Um hum [positive]

P: And uh, I, I (Inaudible ) and it was, it was just embarrassing stuff you know. Having her pick me up from school and stuff you know. Tweak ride and stuff so. 

I: Um hum [positive]

P: I don't knowI just kinda gave up and uh started messing up.

I: Yeah.

P: Yeah.

I: So were you. Would you describe yourself as an easy or difficult kid?

P: Um, we were, we were, we were probably difficult you know we we uh, like I said, like i said we started using at an early age. I was, my brothers were eleven and I was 13. Yeah, but, I don't know. It was probably average I mean we were, we pretty much got to do what we wanted so it wasn't that you know, we just kinda got left along, I mean my mom just kinda left us, let us do what we wanted so she could do her thing and it wasn't...

I: Yeah. So there wasn't like conflict between you and your mom necessarily. Cause y'all were... 

P: Yeah, yeah.

I:...doing what you wanted to do anyhow right?

P: Yeah.

I: Um, did you have a good relationship with your mom and your grandmother as a child?

P: Um, yeah.

I: Okay.  So you said that you, that you and your siblings went and did your own thing and that your mom went and did her own thing. How much was she involved in with the things around the house?

P: Um, [pause] I don't know, she, she, like I said my grandmother did most of the, the cooking and the cleaning and the paying the bills.  You know as far that kind of stuff and you know we were, we were uh, we lived like kind of on the outskirts of town kinda a little bit up by like the catwalk. I don't know if you are familiar with this area but, 

I: Um hum. [positive]

P: It's up by the (Inaudible 0:11:20) up there. There's like a lot of uh, a lot of uh,open, open territory. We had our bikes and our dirt bikes and stuff and we just...

I: [interjecting] So (Inaudible) in that area. 

P: Yeah, yeah.

I: So just go out and...

P: Yeah, yeah

I: ...don't come back till lunch time.  [laughs]

P: Yeah, absolutely. During summers we'd ride out bikes down the cat walk, go swimming all day and do that..

I: Um hum [positive] 

P:...and just come back in the evenings you know so, we had a big old fort. And we had tv's and uh Nintendo's and stuff out there.

I: So that was like the, like the

P: [interjecting]Yeah.

I: Okay. The club house.

P: Yeah, yeah. The club house and had it all fixed up kind of like a little, little house and uh yeah, we just, we had a lot of fun.

I: Okay. Um, would you consider your grandmother and mom good role models for parenting?

P: Yeah uh, now, like I said, my mom's been clean 20 years um, she's been raising my kids and my grandma raised us when we were little.

I: Okay.

P: But uh, motherly type stuff and um, Yeah, yeah,  my mom's real good with my kids, she's raised them real good.  I live with her too but..

I: Okay.

P: ...her and my sister are more like you know, more like the parents. I'm just kinda, I've been in and out of since I was, since I was 21 so

I: Right.

P: Yeah. 

I: Maybe, might uh, a little more continuity you know with them there as well.

P: Yeah. Im just now trying to get back into their lives. You know, but I don't want to get in it too much I'm kinda let, I don't want to like take over my mom and sister's been doing their thing with them so.

I: Right.

P: Yeah.

I: Um so, you mentioned earlier about your mom's van and giving a ride and that was kind of embarrassing. Um, so most kids are embarrassed in one way or another by their parents..

P: Yeah, um.

I: ...So that was one of the things that you were embarrassed about uh while you were in school..

P: Yeah.

I: Was there anything else that was embarrassing?

P: Um, yeah, uh, our house, my grandmother had an older house that they kinda built you know, when my mom and them were little, it's kinda like a shack you know so, kids wanted to come over after school and stuff and play and stuff and we had a little shack I was always trying to go over to their house and you know of some those things are embarrassing but.

I: Right. 

P: And the clothes always weren't you know, back then when your, that age you want the Jordans and the and the, you know the nice stuff, the nice uh, the nice uh, the nice football jackets and all of that stuff so. I was always wanting my mom to get me that stuff and she didn't have any money you know, I was just kinda, yeah, all that kind of stuff.

I: Okay. So, how did you respond to those situations like, so with your mom and the ride, you said, you said that you, at some point you just stopped partaking in the, in the extra curricular activities or,

P: Yeah, I um, I think in the seventh or eight grade you know, I was in that era where, you know I wanted to be all preppy and stuff and then um, when it came time to go to high school, I remember I didn't have the money for the clothes I wanted and stuff like that and uh I kind of just stopped going.

I: Okay.  

P: Yeah. I just didn't go. [Laughs].  I didn't go to high school or nothin you know what I'm sayin. I just started, started using drugs and drink and smoking pot and all of that stuff you know.

I: Okay. Um, did you like school?

P: Yeah.

I: So you, you said you didn't go to high school?

P: Eh uhh [negative]

I: At all? So you just went to eight grade and then stopped going?

P: Yeah.

I: And so did, did that lead to legal problems? Not going to school?

P: No, I uh, back then it wasn't the same as now you know. Back then it was, it wasn't like now kids are uh, deter- or whatever they go after parents, back then, back then it wasn't like that.

I: Okay.

P: It was just uh, you wanna drop you, you drop out? [laughs]

I: Right.

P: Yeah.

I: Okay. 

P: Now a days I know it's a lot different. Kids don't go to school their...

I: They'll come after you right.

P: ...parents definitely get in trouble.  [laughs]

I: Right.

P: Yeah. 

I: Yeah, it's crazy how things change.

P: Yeah.

I: Um, what were your friendships like when you were younger, in your grammar school age.

P: [sight]  Um, like I said we kinda live out of town a little bit so we, it was just me and my brothers and my cousin stayed with us for a, for a while back, we just, we just we had some uh, we had neighbors uh, uh, neighbors, couple neighbor boys that were our age that we uh, just kinda bonded with them and did everything, you know. Like I said we had big club houses and up by the catwalk, we'd swim the catwalk every day in the summer and uh went out in the, went fishing we had some ponds back there and uh, yeah. Pretty much we had these uh, two neighbor kids that were close by that were our good friends.

I: So they, so you had the because you lived where you did you had family there. You had the, those friends and what about school, did you have any friends at school that you hung out with or?

P: Uh, to tell you the truth I can't really remember too much about [pause] I can't remember too much about grade school you know, to tell you the truth. Um, yeah, it was,it was too long ago, I can't really remember [laughs]

I: But you recall at certain times with your cousins and stuff in the summer..

P: {interjecting] Yeah, yeah.

I: and things like..

P: [interjecting] Yeah, yeah.

I:...is that kinda what sticks out in your mind?

P: Yeah, yeah. We had another family up there um, another family up too that were our friend too um. They were fruit (trams?) so they would leave and do their seasonal stuff and come back.  Yeah uh, whenever they were around we did, we um, we walked to school together and all that.

I: Um did you have a favorite teacher during this time frame?

P: I can't remember no teachers names [laughing] to tell you the truth.

I: And so um, you know I asked you earlier about growing up in your house and the whether it was religious or something like that, I'm going to add um, that's going to be a reoccurring theme through the different time frames we talk about.

P: Yeah.

I: And so, um, I'm just, Did your religion, did you have any shifts in your religious beliefs or anything like that growing up or was it pretty stable?

P: There wasn't no religion it was uh, there was no religion, no church or nothing. My mom or my grandma never went to church so.

I: Okay. And that pretty, pretty stable as you grew up?

P: Yeah. 

I: Okay. What about um, discipline or punishment? Um, what was that, what was that experience like growing up in grammar school?

P: there uh, there really wasn't too much. You know, like I said my mom use, was, was usin' so she uh, there wasn't no father figure so you know. It wasn't really, I think my mom felt guilty for doing what she was doing.  My grandma felt bad for us cause our mom was doing, you know what she was doing so there wasn't too much discipline.

I: Okay. Did, whenever there was a conflict between, was there ever a conflict between you and your mom or you and your grandma and that was something that they were put out with or something?

P: Yeah um, I'm sure there was but I mean, shoot we got in trouble for something, we'd just hop on our bike [laughing] take off you know for a few hours and come back when it was dinner time, you know so.

I: Okay, so it was one of those things where you leave and let everything kind of calm down?

P: Yeah,

I: type of thing.

P: Yeah, Yeah.

I: Okay.

P: Yeah, there wasn't um, there wasn't too much punishment really.

I: Okay.  So was there, was there any discipline? I mean, if they, any type of discipline what was it like?

P: Um, there really wasn't none. I mean we never got spanked or nothin' like that, you know, it wasn't uh.

I: Verbal reprimand.

P: Yeah. You know, we'd get yelled at a little and we'd just take off and come back later.

I: Okay.

P: There wasn't no, wasn't no discipline really.

I: Okay. So  we're going to move up into the adolescent time frame. So teenage years you know up through about 18 so uh, you know in between, the kind of 13 to 18 time frame. So um, starting with middle school and junior high, or junior high. What, who was most important at this point in your life to you?

P: Um, probably my grandma.

I: Your grandma. Um, and did you still like school or, or in junior high?

P: Yeah, in junior high I did.

I: Okay, alright. What did uh, what was it about it that you liked?

P: Um, like I said I was kinda preppy then before, I was kinda preppy then so I you know, I hung out with the, with the cool crowd and uh had, had the prettiest girlfriends and was on the basketball team and you know all that stuff, you know, felt good.

I: Okay. And actually that was, the next question was uh, what did you do after school? And so..

P: Yeah. I did basketball practice and all that stuff but you know I just, back then I still,  I could still try to, you know we were all kinda younger and I kinda go around that thing of not bring friends home and going to their house and...

I: Um hum [positive]

P: you know once or twice it was my turn to take people on the to the, out of county things and we'd have this old van and we'd all be sitting there [laughing] and uh, you know, she was using back then and you know I'd try to avoid those situations. It was time for her to pick me up from school, I'd have her park it way down the road.

I: Um hum [positive]

P: And my friend wanted to walk with me and I'm like, "Oh you know..." [laughs]

I: [laughs]

P: it, I didn't want to be associated with you know, with a tweaker family.

I: So you were starting to, is it safe to say you were starting to recognize some of that stuff at that point?

P: Yeah well, it, it was just yeah, I was more self conscious about it at that age.

I: Okay. Alright uh. And would you say that you were still and easy or difficult kid?

P: Uh, I was probably, that was probably about the time I was a little more demanding on my mom. Probably more arguments about you know not having money and not having a nice, nice vehicle to take me to school in and stuff like that, you know.  You know, other people had money of course from their parents and stuff so, whenever they got something new, of course the latest item. I wanted it, she didn't have money so.

I: Right.

P: Yeah I was always, I'm sure she felt bad cause she didn't have money to buy me what I wanted when I was doing so.

I: Yeah. So you started to see a little bit of conflict in that?

P: Yeah.

I: Okay. And so, were you getting in trouble at this point?

P: Uh, no. 

I: Okay.

P: No it wasn't no trouble yet.

I: Okay. Was there anything that uh, that you might have done that you might have gotten in trouble with uh, for that maybe you just got away with? That you just (inaudible 0:22;13) caught you doing anything.

P: Back then, no.

I: Alright.

I: Not, not, not in junior high days.

P: Okay.   [laughing] Shortly after.

I: Uh, was there anything that you might have, oh sorry. Was there anything in your home life the kept you from doing what you wanted to do that may have changed what happened in your later life? So is their things that you wanted to do when you were this age but there was restrictions where you couldn't do it so it might have had an impact later on in life?

P: Uh just like what uh, just like not having money for the things I wanted. Like I said, it was time go to high school and it was time to go school shopping and there wasn't money for the clothes I wanted you know, you know uh, started feeling you know kinda. I don't really know what the feelings were but you know, I decided uh, screw it I aint got money, I'm not going to school looking like some scrub you know and uh, 

I: Um hum [positive]

P: Just didn't go and started to, started messin' up.

I: Yeah. 

P: Yeah. (Inaudible 0:23:14) money and if I would've had what I, what I thought I needed you know to go to school I woulda went but...

I: Yeah.

P: You know I got it in my head that if I didn't have that stuff I wasn't going and [laughing] that's what I did.

I: Right.

P: Yeah.

I: Okay. Um what was your relationship with your, with your mom and your grandmother like when you were a teenager?

P: [sigh] Um, my mom ended up gettin clean.

I: [interjecting] How old were you?

P: She's been clean 20 years so I was, I guess, um, 17.

I: Okay. So that's,

P: [interjecting] 16 or 17. (Inaudible, 0:23:55) like 16 or so. So I had already been uh, I had already been using for a few years.

I: Okay. 

P: Like I said I started using, using meth when I was 13 so. Uh, my teenage years were, at first it didn't really matter, it didn't hurt too much I don't think  cause she was using so. Then when she go clean, she was more tryin' to, you know trying to get, get, get me and my brothers clean and we uh, you know we had already been using for a few years so, we just uh, I mean I kept using until, I got, I got my first felony when I was 16.

I: Um hum [positive]

P: And um, my second one when I was 19 so,

I: Okay.

P: I ended up going to prison when I was 21.

I: So when you were, when you started using meth at 13, um, how often were you using it?

P: Everyday.

I: Everyday.

P: Yeah.  Back when my mom was cooking it she had uh, she had this junk of this transam that the motor block cracked in it so she used it for storing her stuff and one day she left her keys in the bathroom, we went and had one made and that's how we uh supplied ourselves, we stole dope out of there for, 

I: Um hum [positive]

P: for a good year, year and a half.

I: Oh, okay and so did she know that you were using?

P: Yeah, she knew. Yeah. Yeah, she knew but she didn't know where we was gettin' it or anything like that and like I said she was doing, she was...

I: [interjecting] She wasn't making the connection that she was, that you were getting it from her.

P: No. [laughs]

I: alright.

P: Yeah.

I: Um and so still, so, [pause]. So you're still living with your grandmother and your mom?

P: Yeah, I'm, well with my mom. My grandmother still stays in the same house, my mom, my mom got another place out in Palermo.  She's raising my kids so.

I: Oh, I'm talking about when you were 13.

P: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

I: Okay. Um, and, if there was something that, if you got in trouble, the discipline thing again, that it was...

P: [interjecting] Yeah.

I: ...what was the most significant discipline you've experienced.

P: There really wasn't none, I meant to tell you, to tell you the truth. As far as getting the bikes taken or anything like that or, there was nothing like that.

I: So if there was, if they didn't like what you were doing there was a verbal reprimand that was...

P: [interjecting] yeah

I: Okay, alright.

P: Yeah. I'm sure it wasn't easy raising uh, three teenage boys and uh a [laughing] little sister cause we were you know. We were kinda, we, we kinda got big at a young age you know, tall and this and that, we were kinda, yeah, we, we just did what we wanted. [laughs] There wasn't no one tellin' us what to do.

I: Um, do you feel like they cared? Your mom and, and your grandmother?

P: Oh yea.

I: Okay. 

P: Yeah, they cared.

I: Okay. [pause] Do you feel like that you had a good role model for parenting during those years?

P: Um, not, not, well not my mom.  My grandma, my grandma was always, my grandma was never using, she's always had her little job and you know, made sure, made sure we had food.

I: Um hum [positive]

P: Maybe not the nicest clothes but she made sure we had some clothes.

I: Okay.

P: Yeah. My grandma was a good role model. She always has been, yeah.

I: Okay, um hum [positive]. What was your relationship with other people in authority when you were in middle school and high school? So you didn't, you didn't attend high school, but let's, so let's talk about middle school. What was your relationship with people in authority? So principles, teachers?

P: Um, back then the only thing I, the only thing I um, like I said I did pretty good back then you know, I was kinda, I was kinda a bigger kid though so of course I'd always get elected to go, you know I got in some fights you know, you  know that was. I had this close, one of my basketball uh, teammates he was a good, real good friend of mine and he was always instigating and I was bigger so I was always...

I: [Interjecting] You had to back him up.  [laughing]

P: I was always uh, I was always going and doing the fighting so you know I got in a little trouble for that but that's about it yeah.

I: Okay. And so when you, when you got in trouble what was you, I mean what did you think of the authority figures and so, if you go in trouble, the teacher, or whatever or coach or whatever, what were the uh, what were your thoughts on the way that they handled the situation. 

P: Um, to tell you the truth, I cant really remember too much of that.

I: Okay.

P: I can't uh, you know really get mad at the principle for suspending me for fighting or something, but that was, other than that, I was, was good in school. I got good grades, I was good on the basketball team, you I was, I was taller and stuff so I was really good on the basketball team and you I just uh, can't really remember too much about it you know, except for getting into fights, a little of that, but you know.  Other than that, I was just trying to fit in and be one of the popular kids you know.

I:  Yeah. Um, [pause] so you said you caught your first felony at 16? 

P: Yeah.

I: Is that right?  And so is that the first time that you got in trouble with the law?

P: Yeah.

I: And what was that over?

P: I was uh, like I said I already using. Me and my good friend of mine were cutting, cutting some firewood, we were cutting down a tree. We cut down some firewood and sell it so we could get some money for some dope and uh, end up gettin' in trouble by the game warden and caught our first felony (Inaudible, 0:29:18).

I: So what was the charge?

P: Uh, grand theft.

I: Of a tree?

P: Yeah. 

I: From state or, 

P: It was private property.

I: Private property.

P: Yeah. They ended up contacting the owners and doing that yeah so. I think it cost like, $5,000. They charged us for, for cutting the tree down. [laughing] Yeah.

I: Um so looking back on it do you think that that was a serious situation or maybe just a part of grown' up?

P: You know, I don't think that, we actually got 'em, cause we had a friend that lived kind of close by and they had a lot of private property, we actually thought it was on their property.

I: Um hum [positive]

P: It was like right on the, right on the you know. Were we grew up there aint really no fences it's you know, other people know where the property is but we thought it was a friend of ours, you know um. Nah, I didn't think it was that serious.  We didn't think we was doin' no crime though.  We was just cutting down some wood to go sell you know.

I: Okay.

P: It's kinda like our backyard out there you know and the people are kind of our, are kind of like, my friends kind of (Inaudible: 0:30:24) So we, we..

I: Right.

P: ...we didn't ask for permission but we though it was his families property and found out it wasn't so, no I didn't think it was anything serious.

I: Okay. So, would you change anything um, during this time frame if you could? If you could go back and change it?

P: If I could uh, the only thing, the only thing I'd change is not using meth cause you know it, it, it made me have an addiction throughout my whole, whole life you know. I

I: Yeah.

P: It's been uh, see I was 13 and I'm 37, that's 24 years of, of using so.

I: That's a long time.

P: Yeah. [laughing].  I, I was gonna say luckily I've been in prison a lot, it kinda kept me off of it. I've spent um, I've spent a lot of years in prison, I guess it's not right to say I was lucky. [laughs] But uh, you know it kept me off. My brother, one of my younger brothers he's, he's been on it the whole time since, the whole 24 years.

I: Which one?

P: Uh, Jesse.

I: Jesse.

P: Yeah he, he looks like he's about 50 years old.

I: Really?

P: Yeah he's never been to prison. He stays up there in kinda the little mountains and but yeah he's been using meth the whole time and he, boy he looks bad.

I: Um hum [positive]

P: But I guess he has freedom for all of these years I was in prison so I don't know which is worse.

[both laugh]

P: Being in prison and still looking halfway decent or lookin' tore up.

I: So if you could go back it would, it would.

P: It would be stayin in school and not, not, not get a drug addiction.

I: Okay. And so, that's an interesting relationship between the school and the drugs you talked about cause you, you said that you stopped going to school because you, there was a certain person that you wanted, there was a certain group that you wanted to hang out with and in order to hang out with this group you had to have certain things...

P: Yeah.

I: And so you were, you did want, you said you didn't want to go to school looking like a scrub.

P: Yeah.

I: Right. So you stayed, you avoided the school situation but you said that also coincided with the time that you started using drugs.

P: Yeah, yeah.  Some people would think you know that hey, you know the lifestyle that your parents were in is the cause of not havin' money and stuff like that. Like most people that (Inaudible, 0:32:27) If you're raised around this certain, like my mom did a lot of meth and she had a lot of friends that were, between people coming around and stuff and this this uh, I don't know it's weird. Someone that didn't, wasn't brought up in that kind of lifestyle would probably think, well why would he do something that was the cause of you know of not being able to.

I: Umm [positive]

P: But uh, you just brought up in that lifestyle and uh, I don't know you just kinda do it cause that's what everyones doing I guess. I mean, I for-, I mean I forget even why we fir-, first did it we uh, want into the van that she cooked her meth in and we seh went some where and we broke into it and found all of her drugs and so we I think one of our friends who said, "Oh yeah you snort that" or somethin'. We did a little.

I: Um hum [positive]

P: Just uh, it wasn't plan or anything. I think we wer going in their to look for some money or something but I found a little something and ended up doing it and shoot I went back the next day and like I said we found a key to her trunk of her car and started gettin' some, some real sacs and I don't know it wasn't planned it was just, just kinda, but. Like I could see from someone's perspective that it would, you would think that someone wouldn't do drugs because it was, the uh, cause of, it just happened. 

I: Now I wasn't suggestion that that. Yeah, I was just curious of the timing of that it um that it was that you stopped, that you stopped going to school and then started the using.

P: It's hard for me to memorize, uh, I might even um, I might of even started using like summer before high school maybe even.

I: Oh, okay

P: You know partying a little and this and that. That might even have something to do with it. To tell you the truth I can't really 'member.

I: Okay.

P: But it was right around the same time. I might of even started doing, doing something that summer, you know

I: Okay.

P: And uh, shoot that might of [laughs] that might of been part of too not wanting to go but uh, I can't, to tell you the truth, I honestly cant remember if, it was right around the same time.

I: Um hum [positive]

P: I might have started using that summer.

I: Okay, alright. Um, Im gonna, we're gonna move into early adulthood um so, um, you know 18 on and um, so talk about some relationships and things like that. Get into being being a parent and things like that so um. I'm just gonna read, I know the answer to this but I'm just going to read the questions and let you answer it.

P: Alright.

I: Did you ever have a serious relationship or get married?

P: At that age?

I: At 18 forward.

P: Um,

I: So once you were an adult. Well I mean if you got married before then.

P: Um I, I did get married, I mean I got uh, I had relationships.  Serious relationships back yeah.

I: When did you start having serious relationships?

P: Shoot probably uh, I was 16.

I: Okay.

P: I was 15, 16 somewhere around there. I had a steady girlfriend back then, yeah. And uh, I got married uh, 9 years ago I think was the first time I got married so.

I: Oh, okay.

P: I was like 28.

I: Okay.

P: I ended up knocking this girl up and she had my first born and I married her before.

I: Okay.

P: Before she had him

I: And so, um, so did you have serious relationships from, like so you had a steady girlfriend from 15, 16.

P: Yeah, right.

I: And so how long did that last for?

P: Um [sigh]. Probably a few months.

I: Okay.

P: A few months and then. Yeah like those were like the younger teenage relationships, but probably, you know um, [pause]  I had a uh, one of the (Inaudible) were fruit tramps, the girl with uh, that was kinda like my first love. I was like 16 and uh, you know I date her, she'd go do their little fruit running, fruit run and then come back and I'd

I: [Interjecting] So I, I just need to clar-, a fruit tramp, did they go out and harvest or they go out, or what do they do?

P: Yeah, they did like make the rounds. They'd go like up to Washington and do apples and go to Stockton and do Cherries and...

I: Oh, okay. So they harvested all of the fruit.

P: Yeah. So, so they'll go to Washington for a few months, come back for a month and then go to Stockton (Inaudible 0:36:54)

I: Alright [laughs]

P: Yeah, well, there's not really too many, there's not really to many of them because there's not a lot of harve-, I mean there's..

I: Um hum [positive]

P: ...but yeah that's what, what's what they, they did when they were younger so that was like my first love.

I: Okay.

P: She ended up, mom ended up marrying her dad and she's, she's my step sister now but.

I: Oh, okay. Do y'all get along now?

P: Yeah, yeah. Saw her the other day at home depot.

I: Good.

P: Yeah.

I: Um, so after that relationship, did you have other serious relationships?

P: Um, 

I: Or when did that relationship end, I guess?

P: It went on like that till, it went on like that for a few years you know. She, she'd come back for a month or so and you know for a few months and you now uh. So it was probably 2 or 3 years that I was with her.

I: Okay. And, and so you started dating her around 15 or 16 and so that puts you right around 19 whenever y'all stopped dating. Did, and you said you caught your second felony at 19?

P: Yeah. Caught my second felony and had to go to a couple rehabs and all that and get (Inaudible 0:37:54) and ended up failing that and when I was 21 I went and did a term.

I: Okay. So you, so you got felony probation and and residential treatment. So I guess it was a, a drug charge.

P: Uh yeah.

I: What was the charge?

P: Possession. 

I: Okay, that.

P: Yeah.

i: Okay and so you got a, you got a , they sent you to a rehab or a program and gave you 5 years felony probation...

P: Yeah.

I: You did two of that term and then...

P: Yeah.

I: Whatever they, then they decide they're gonna send you off.

P: Yeah so I, yeah so I went to prison when I was 21.

I: So did they um, so the, when you caught that felony case, the your, significant other...

P: Yeah.

I: ...your girlfriend at the time, was is, was that a part of y'all loosing contact or was, had you lost contact prior to that?

P: Uh, she ended up uh, when she was, like I said I went and dated her for a few years and I think by the third year she ended up coming back and she was pregnant you know.

I: Um hum [positive]

P: You but, you know I still, I still see her a little bit but uh, um. About that time my addiction was, my addiction was, was more important than you know.

I: Um hum [positive]

P: (inaudible 0:39:00) I had been using for quite a few years now so I didn't really uh, you know what I mean, I still loved her but, I was running around getting high, [laughing] doing other things was more important so. She'd be gone and I'd be seeing other girls and 

I: Okay.

P: And she'd come back and you know it was, you know I'd go see her and stuff it wasn't...

I:  So it just kinda turned out as a casual relationship towards the end?

P: Yeah, yeah.  I mean she came back pregnant you know at like 19 (Inaudible) but I mean we get older and you know and she, she was pregnant with someone else's kid it wasn't, it wasn't mind so [laughs]

I: Right.

P: I'll still go see her but uh, yeah she (Inaudible, 0:39:40) [laughs]

I: Right, yeah. That's, that's a game changer.

P: Yeah. [laughs]

I: Um, so the next question, how did that turn out? But so let's talk about um, so, between uh, so how long were you in CDC when you were incarcerated when you were 21?

P: Oh, I , I didn't do that long. I did 16 months, half (violation?) or term so. I only did like 8 months.

I: Okay. And then you got back out and they, did they put you back on probation or not?

P: Parole.

I: Parole, okay so they paroled you out and that, so that was the end of your term for the..

P: Yeah.

I:..for that case.  How long were you on parole for?

P: Oh, I , I did, I, I did a bunch of violations and stuff. Uh back then wasn't like now, back then uh, like I sai this was '96. I went in and got out you know in the begining of '97 uh. It was way different back then you uh, test you all the time, one dirty test you're going back to prison and stuff like that.

I: So you transitioned back and fourth right?

P: Oh yeah.

I: How many terms did you serve?

P: I've done four terms and 13 violations. This is my fifth term now on county prison now.

I: So when you talk about terms, that's sentences.

P: Yeah.

I: Okay. How many violations?

P: 13.

I: So you went back to prison...

P: 17 times

I: 17 times and 13 of them on violations.

P: Yeah.

I: Okay.

P: Yeah back then it wasn't like now. Like then you get like a year, year and a half for just anything.

I: Right.

P: So yeah it was uh it was bad back then.  They had plenty of room in prison and if you messed up, yeah so.

I: So you, so you got, you did your first 8 months on that violation and then how long were you back in the community?

P: Probably only like two months.

I: Okay.

P: Two months uh, I got out, started, started using a little bit and I ended up getting a dirty test and got sent right back down there and...

I: What was that process like so you get out after 8 months and you...

P: [interjecting] It was uh, it was um, [sigh] (Inaudible) I felt that, I felt that they took time away from, out of my life and uh, I missed out on some things...

I: Um hum [positive]

P: ...and uh, I needed to catch up a little you know [laughs]

I: Right.

P: And uh, I get out and you know, kinda have some anger issues for them taking me away from my, you know taking me uh, away from my freedoms and uh, I ended up partying a little bit, [snaps fingers] as quick as you know it man they test you or something. Hand cuff you back up and send you again and get out (inaudible 0:42:10) you know. Yeah, I mean it was my own doing but you  know, back then I wasn't doing no crimes, I was just, I was just using I mean.

I: Um hum [positive]

P: I mean, the felony I got was just for like less than a quarter gram of dope, you know.

I: Um hum [positive]

P: It wasn't even, you know it was, it wasn't even. It was just in between my dresser, I had some little crumbs and it was, back then they had a strict uh, drug free zone and all that stuff and uh uh the neighborhood watch made a drug free zone so that's how I got a felony out of it, it wasn't like nothing you know so. Back then I was, I was just getting high and not really, we weren't doing no crimes, we weren't stealing, I wasn't you know, nothing like that. 

I: Right.

P: Like I said I went to prison a lot of times [laughs] I just uh, just my, just for using drugs.

I: So you um, alright so you had the, you had the felony for the, the tree incident as a juvenile. Then you had the felony, your first felony for the possession and then you, and how many violations did you go back for on that term?

P: Uh, I maxed my number out. What they do is they give you 3 years parole. As soon as you do your term and they let you out on parole you have three years...

I: Um hum [positive]

P: But if you one violation then (Inaudible) they're gonna make it for years so, um. So you got a four year time frame so, if you get out for a month or two you know that's still part of the four years but then you go in say you get a year and a half and go to six and a half months uh, keep doing that until for years is up and then like maximum your number out.

I: So did you max out on the violations for that particular term? Do you remember?

P: Um I did a of my, almost the whole four years.

I: Okay. 

P: You know what I mean. I'd be gone for 7 or 8 months and be out for one or two and back in.

I: And, and so then your third case.  What was that for?

P: Humm [pause]. I think receiving uh, um driving without owners consent.  I um, I had this girlfriend back, I had this girlfriend and um she had this car that I guess she took it from her boyfriend or somethin' and I was driving and 

I: Um hum [positive]

P: she was the passenger at the casino. He reported it stolen and I, I was, they had me on tape being the driver so [laughs]

I: So they charged you with uh, unauthorized us of or, grand larceny or

P: Yeah, pretty much like...

I: Like grand theft auto?

P: Grand theft auto, yeah.

I: Um and so but is that what they ended up sentencing you on or did they or was it receiving stolen property?

P: Yeah. It was uh, driving a vehicle without owners consent.

I: Oh okay, alright.

P: It's the same amount of time and all that just different wording.

I: Um, and how long were you, how long did you stay inc...

P: [Interjecting] I got a um, I think I got two years on that.

I: Okay.

P: Two, two years with half. Did a little over a year and uh

I: And then you were, and then you got that three year...

P: [interjecting] And then yeah you start parole again and then you do one violation, you add another year on so I did my term a little over a year and the did uh, you know, four years due to violations back and fourth.

I: And when, what year was that that you caught that case?

P: [sigh] Lets see, [mumbling], I think 2002.

I: 2002, so about 10 or 11 years ago.

P: 10.

I: Okay.

P: 2002, uh, did the same thing back then you know, you do any little thing you get back and uh, did the same thing, four years on uh, in and out and I maxed out my number.  Was on parole maybe a month or two and uh, a month or two and I caught um, I caught anther um, uh grand theft auto.

I: Okay.

P: And uh went on a high speed chase and the spike stripped me and all that, got a uh, they ended up uh giving me uh, like a reckless driving tac-, whatever uh, you know driving too fast kind putting people in danger.  I forget what it's called but

I: So the you, you didn't catch a felony on that one then?

P: Yeah

I: Oh you did, okay.

P: Yeah. But uh, so I got that in uh, [sigh] 2008, 2009 or something.

I: Okay so, alright so four or five years ago?

P: Yeah.

I: And so how long did you stay on that one?

P: Um, I got three years eight months.

I: Alright.

P: Um, end of uh, maybe it was just a, [thinking] well that was the last one, maybe there was one between.  There was a receiving of stolen property or something that I went in on and I got a uh, three years eight months. And then before my, I went to fire camp then before my time was up before the parole was maxed out I caught another felony which you get a new number and all that and um...

I: Um hum [positive]

P: Same number, you have the same number, and uh I caught four years, eight months on that and went to fire camp again so.

I: What was that felony for?

P: Um, yeah, the one I was telling you about was the last one, the one before that was receiving stolen property. I was on parole and then they found me with some stolen property and gave me a new, a new felony.  Which if you still have your number, it's the same number but yeah so.

I: New charge.

P: Yeah.

I: You caught a new case.

P: Yeah caught a new case and it starts your parole over and all that so you got your four years again.

I: So I'm gonna, I'd like to go back through this so I understand and make sure I got it right.

P: Yeah.

I: So we start off, we have the tree incident when you were 15 or 16

P: [Interjecting] 16

I: And then you were 19 you caught the second and um you maxed our your parole time, the four year deal, return on that then you come out of that um, how old were you when you caught your um, the unauthorized use?

P: Probably 24 maybe.

I: 24. Okay so, so it was right after you had uh, got done with parole.

P: Yeah.

I: And, and you caught that case. That was the one that you were with your girlfriend going to the casino.

P: Yeah.

I: Okay and then and you went and did your four

P: [Interjecting] Yeah did all, did, did, did my did my uh, two years and a half term.  Did my four years of violations of back and fourth and then about one or two months after that, I got receiving stolen property.

I: And what was the situation on that one?

P: Uh, I had a um, I wasn't quite off parole yet. Yeah, I had a um, I went and stole some stuff, parole came and they found it in the back of my truck.

I: Okay.

P: Yeah. So I went and did three years and eight months on that.

I: So when you, In that, in that situation, in the stolen property were you, was that to supply your drug habit?

P: Yeah, yeah.

I: Okay. Alright.

P: Yeah.

I: So you were already back, you were back into it again?

P: Yeah.

I: Alright.

P Like I said, the earlier years when I first, first started using, it was just all about getting high it wasn't no, you know and then. About the time I, I did af few, did my first term or did a few violations over just you know, dirty tests and stuff. I started you know, I started gettin' a little anger issues and 

I: Um [positive]

P: Started you know, blaming them you know, they took me away from you know my freedom and uh...

I: Right

P: Started uh, started escalating, you know started to meet new people, you meet a lot of people in prison and they, their doin' other things, you know, you start getting ideas you know...

I: [interjecting]  Right.

P: They're doing this and they're makin' money doin this and so you know I started es-, probably started escalating you know. Started going out and doing some petty burglaries and and uh, uh things just escalated. [sigh] You learn a lot of stuff in prison. [Laughs]

I: Right.

P: Yeah it wasn't, it definitely wasn't uh  what they meant it to be as far as the rehabilitation type deal man. You just go in there and get, sit in the cell and be angry and learn a lot of new stuff from convicts. [laughs]

I: Right, right. People that are, yeah.

P:  It was uh, definitely wasn't uh, definitely wasnt uh, they weren't on the right path the way the system used to be.

I: Yeah.

P: Yeah. The way it is now is just so much, I mean if it were still the way it was now, it used to be you know, I would get out of prison and just do the same stuff but you know their, now they way the got it, they kinda give you a change and try to teach you some new uh, new habits and it's a whole lot better.

I: Yeah that's, I think that's what they're trying to accomplish so, um, so [pause]. The reason why I ask about the, your criminal background is so I can can put it in context of your, cause your, how old, how many children do you have?

P: Two.

I: Two and how old are they?

P: One's seven and one's almost eleven.

I: Eleven okay and so, you didn't, so the first couple of incarceration periods you didn't have children.

P: No.

I: Right? And then and so you've been incarcerated after having children?

P: Oh yeah.

I: Okay, alright so and that's, I want to be able to distinguish between the time that you're incarcerated without children between the time that you're incarcerated with children.

P: Okay.

I: And so that's why I was trying to get the time frame down on that.

P: Yeah.

I: Um, and so, during this period, you did a lot of the in and out.

P: Yeah.

I: In and out of the system. Right and so during that time was, was a long term serious relationship something pragmatic, that was reasonable for you?

P: No, every time I get a girlfriend, I'd get locked up again, you know. It was uh, when you get locked up with a girlfriend she ain't going to last you know. I've pretty much left to you know, you stop getting letters then she's with somebody else so.

I: Right.

P: That was, that was my uh, relationship back, back then was uh get out and you know, run around with a girl or something, get high and have a little fun and I get locked up and get out and find a new one and start over.  [laughs]

I: Right. Right. Okay. Um, [pause] so tell me about getting married. Tell me about your wife.

P:  Um, it wasn't your typical marriage uh, I just out, got out of prison on a violation, got out you know, did a violation, got out I was on parole, met her, we was using together and uh, uh probably about two months using and she got, bout the time that I figured out that I really didn't like her uh, she told me she was pregnant. [laughs] And uh, I tried to get her to get an abortion you know cause I was in my addiction and she wouldn't do it so. It ened up, I was going to court on a charge that they charged me with before I met her and uh, and uh, I didn't want no kids you know and I tried to get her to get an abortion she didn't want to do it so. It ended up, I ended getting locked up for the charge I had to go to court on and uh, I married her in county jail right before, like a couple months before she had my, my she had my kid. 

I: Okay so you were married before...

P: [interjecting] I married her in the county before I got shipped off to prison.

I: So you were incarcerated at the county jail and y'all were able to do that in there?

P: Yeah.

I: Okay.

P: Yeah so,

I: What's her name? 

P: Vanessa.

I: Vanessa, okay. I'm just, so that I can refer back to her.

P: Yeah. Yeah so, like I said, it was just drugs, uh, uh, she wasn't uh, she wasn't really nothin' uh I planned on havin' a kid with.

I: Yeah.

P: Yeah. 

I: And so, what year did y'all get married?

P: 2002.

I: Okay. And uh, are y'all still together?

P: No.

I: And um, what happened, well I'll do the, how did it turn out I guess?

P: Uh, she had my kid right after I got shipped out. Um actually I married her from county jail, she had my (the?) kid um.  Back then I honestly tried, when I went to prison I read a lot of books and stuff on parenting, tried this and towards the end of my term um, some people came in that I knew and they said she was out using and this and that and she was screwing around and this and that and uh, so I, I got out you know and uh. I started the path of uh finding out a lot of things about her [laughing] what she did when I was trying to be good and uh...

I: Right.

P:... re- uh, return the favor I guess you could say and uh, I'd get angry and go use and go uh find other girlfriends and uh, that was the back and fourth pattern with me and her. I'd last about two months, get locked up and uh, you know it was uh, it wasn't too much of a marriage there.

I: Okay.

P: I was in and out of prison.

i: Okay.

P: I mean we tried to make it work a couple times when I got out. I'd always find out new things and she was using a lot so I ended up doing the same thing and using and get locked back up. It was uh, an unhealthy relationship.

I: Yeah. And so are you divorced now?

P:  Um hum. [positive]

I: And, when did you get divorced?

P: We got divorced uh, maybe two years ago.

I: Okay.

P: I was in prison, she sent papers.

I: And do you still have contact with her?

P: No, not really.

I: So it wasn't uh, it, it didn't end on a good note?

P: No.

I: Okay. Um so, you were in CDC whenever your first child was born? Is that correct?

P: I was in CDC when both of my childs were born.  [laughs] Yeah.

I: Okay.

P: But yeah, the first one I was.

I: How did you find out about the delivery?

P: Oh about the, the kid?

I: Yeah.

P: Oh probably a letter or a phone call. Probably a phone call.

I: Okay. And how did that make you feel?

P: Um, like I said, back then I really was trying to be a good parent you know I felt good, I felt good about getting out and uh, and having a wife and a kid and all that and uh, of course uh, she wasn't on the same path, she was out using and uh, end up uh, end up getting some anger issues you know.

I: Yeah.

P: Cause that was my kid and I married her and uh she was in her addiction too. She um decided to use and uh, I had a lot of anger the way I dealt with it was going to use drugs myself.

I: Yeah. And, so she's the parent, she's the mother of both of your children?

P: Um hum [positive]

I: Okay and so. When was your second child born?

P: Uhh let's see this is uh 13, 2006?

I: Okay and so when did you and her get divorced? When did you and Vanessa get divorced? Two years ago?

P: We divorced uh, yeah about two years ago.

I: Okay. And

P: Maybe three years ago. It was two or three years ago.

I: Okay, alright. What are your uh, children's names?

P: Children's names? Shawn and Kayden.

I: That's right, alright.  I can't find my note so.

P: [laughs]

I: [pause] And so, was Vanessa involved in raising your children?

P: Uh, not too much. Like I said uh, when my oldest boy was two, just before Kayden was born um, I was in prison and uh, my wife was doing her thing and CPS came and uh, took my oldest, took my boy and uh, even since then my mom's had guardianship.

I: Okay and then what about Kayden.

P: Uh, Kayden's uh, Kayden was only, probably less than a year old uh, my wife messed up again and CPS came and my mom got him too.

I: Okay alright so,

P: My mom's had both kids since they were babies.

I: Okay. and so um would you, is it accurate to say that your mom is that maternal role for your kids?

P: My mom and sister.

I: Mom and sister, okay.  

P: Yeah my sister, my mom and sister been living together ever since, ever since my oldest boy was two when he got (inaudible) from CPS they got a place together and um, and raised them.

I: Okay.

P: My wife's been in prison, she's uh, she might have just went back to prison again I think. She's not, yeah, she's not really, she hasn't been to prison, she's only been to prison once, I think she might have just went back but when she's out, she don't have much contact with the kids.

I: Does she have contact with then when she's in?

P: No.

i: Okay. Um, so I'm going to ask you this question but it sounds like uh, you've already answered it for be, but do you think that, would you say that she is a good parent?

P: No.

I: Okay. But they have your mom and your sister and you feel like that they are...

P: [Interjecting] Like yeah, they're really good.

I: Would you say that you're, that you've been a good parent?

P: No, absolutely not.

I: Okay.

P: Can't be a parent from prison. [laughs]

I: Right. That's exactly what we're looking at is, you know how that works. Um, how would you compare how you parented to how your parents parented you?

P: Um, [pause,sigh] I can't um, the only judgment is my, my mom was, my mom didn't go to prison and I have. You know it's, it's the same kind of. She probably did worse things but she never went to prison so she was out there in the community around us, you know.

I: Right.

P: I probably did less worse things but I've been to prison a lot so um, I guess you'd say she was a better parent than me.

I: Okay.

P: (Inaudible) I haven't done anything worse just uh, got caught. I got caught a lot more I guess you know what I mean. [laughing] yeah and uh, when she be doin' things it was before they got real strict on, on what they did... 

I: Right.

P: and then when, they time when I started messing up is when they were really strict on uh, on any kind of drug use and all that. The drug use was, that's the main thing they was wantin' to stop the drug use.

I: Right.

P: Anyone associating with drugs or used drugs was gone.

I: Right. 

P: Now it's, now it's different era, now it's you know, drug use aint really that big of deals, crimes.

I: Right.

P: You know, they're keeping people in the community more.

I: Yeah.

P: They're trying to work with them, to help them out.  Now it's more people do the serious crimes and the violent stuff's the people gone, you know.

I: Um, so, can you describe your relationship with Shawn and Kayden?

P Um [pause] It's good as far as, the love they have for me now but as far as um, I kinda mentioned earlier, as far as me being a parent and making them breakfast and making them dinner and getting them ready for school. I don't, I don't do none of that

I: Um hum. [positive]

P: Like I said I don't want to interfere too much.  My mom and sister been doing it since they were little kids. Their routine they do um, I don't like to interfere so much um, they got a pretty good little system.  Um, uh, its not really too, it's a little overw-, with the youngest, Kayden he's a little easier, my oldest he's almost eleven it's more of a little back talking a little bit, "You aint been around, you can't tell me what to do", you know so um, I just got to improve myself, stay out and uh go in slowly with them. You know cause it was um, it's not their fault I aint been there, it's mine um, I havent been around to tell them, there're not too much, my oldest doesn't have too much respect for me because I've been gone so I gotta earn their respect.

I: Yeah.

P: Yeah so. The littler one, he's been a little more forgiving you know he's he's, the age I was gone, he was littler so 

I: Right.

P: A little more of a um, a little more of a, you dont really think about it, it's not too much of an issue with him.  The oldest the oldest, is uh, there were a few years too long with him so.  I gotta earn my respect back now

I: Okay.  Would you describe yourself as involved in their lives when they were little?

P:No.

I: Okay.

P: Like I said. Every time I got out I'd have anger issues with my wife, I'd find out a lot of things she did and uh uh, I chose um drugs over uh, trying to work out, through the issues and forgiving her. Uh, I chose the uh, go get high and get the same thing she was doing

I: Okay. And so we've talked a little bit about your incarceration experience and going through those and getting this line out but we're gonna um, I want to go back through here. Some of these I'm going to answer but I'm going to need you to confirm that, that I'm correct.

P: Okay.

I: So the first time you went to jail um, were you incarcerated in juvenile hall for the tree thing?

P: No.

I: Okay. The first time you went to jail was for the felony at 19?

P: Yeah.

I: Okay, alright and you were and on that particular stay you were incarcerated for somewhere around eight months?

P: Yeah.

I: And then you got out but then you had, you went back multiple times for the parole revocations.

P: Yeah.

I: Okay um, and so all this occurred before you were ever a parent and so you weren't a parent until your third...?

P: Yeah, it was..

I: Your second was at 19.

P: Yeah, so third, yeah.

I: Third and so, okay. Um, so the when was the first time that you went to the, the first time that you were incarcerated after being a parent? Or while being a parent was which charge? Was the the receiving stolen property?

P:  Um, [sigh] [laughs] It's been so many times.

I: Right.

P: I've never really stopped to think about it now I try to I try to keep that (Inaudible) um, yeah I's say the third felony.

I: Okay. [pause] When did it first hit you that you were going to be separated from your children?

P: [pause] See uh, [pause] like when uh, when I got the third felony I was already, I sometimes (Inaudible) go through violation, I was on my last violation getting ready to max my time out and then they filed charges on something I did before, before I went in so.

I: Ahh [positive]

P: I've already, I already, I already did the crime and did a violation and they filed charges right before I got out and just charged my number so. When I met my wife and got her pregnant, I was already going to court.

I: Um hum. [positive]

P: You know I was free but I was going to court on...

I: [Interjecting] So you were already...

P: [Interjecting] Something I did a year before.

I: Right.

P: I was, I had to go to court on it so I. One of the main things, one of the main reasons I wanted her to get an abortion and all that you know I, I did, I didn't uh intentionally get her pregnant. So it was just, I was going to court you know, using and I didn't really want a family so.

I: Right.

P: Yeah So I already knew I was going to get time and go in and that's why I wanted a divorce but she wouldn't so. Um I married her and all that stuff like I said beforehand and really tried to change my life and uh, while I was in there she was doing what she did. End up when I get out, when I got out she was real skinny and uh in her addiction and uh I tried for a minute and then like you know what, screw it.

I: Okay. So the next question is who took care of your kids and that was your mom and your sister right?

P: [Interjecting] My mom and my sister. Yeah, Yeah.

I: And um, did you ever have to have a conversation with maybe your kids teachers or parents or friends or anything like that about why you're leaving or anything like that?

P: No. I was never uh, like I said my mom and sister always did all that. I'd get out and just kinda, kinda stay with them and try to be there and end up uh, you know end up uh doing drugs instead. I've never went to a parent, parent teacher conference. I never did any of that kind of stuff.

I: Okay. Were you able to maintain a relationship with your children while you were in custody?

P: Um I guess, you could say that I mean I guess I pretended like I was part of their lives. You know I'd call and talk to them and...

I: Um hum [positive]

P: ...draw them stuff or write them or all that stuff but uh, you know but realistically there really aint, you not being a parent if you're in prison.

I: Right.

P: Pretend you know, try to make your kids feel a little better but I mean you yourself know your not being a good parent.

I: Right. Where were you uh, where were you at? What unit? What facility?

P: Oh in prison?

I: Yeah.

P: Oh I've been to all kinds of prisons.

I: Were you in the local area or were you so far removed that it's hard for visitation?

P: Yeah, there's really, there's really not too. The closest one probably is up in Susanville.

I: Um hum [positive]

P: And uh, I've been there a few times but I've been as far as Corcoran and their uh. My mom and sister were struggling back then to raise the kids and this and that. I wasnt really, I might have seen them every two or three months, you know.

I: But they did make the, they were able to come down and visit sometimes?

P: Yeah. Yeah.

i: And how is it, how was that visitation?

P: It was good. I was happy to see my kids and all that. Yeah visits in prison are always good.

I: Yeah.

P: But um, yeah it's like uh, I don't know I just went wild getting out, getting the same, I had (Inaudible) like I said that back then but I picked the wrong girls to get pregnant I guess. You know what  I mean. [laughs]

I: [Laughs]

P: I don't try to blame somebody else you know but um, uh I know my heart telling me, someone that was willing to, doing what I was wanting to do I would have got out, I think stayed clean.

I: Might have made it a little easier?

P: Yeah, I mean I'm not trying to put it off on anybody else but I definitely didn't pick a winner. [laughs]

I: Alright fair enough. Um, [pause] So in maintaining that relationship with your children while you were incarcerated was there anybody that made this easier for you?

P: Oh yea. My mom, she was real good about uh, on Christmas, her and my sister would buy presents and put my name on it and you know, things like that which you know, made it look like I was being more of a parent. I'd talk to them and "Oh thank you for the new bike" or whatever you know. [laughs] (Inaudible, 1:09:00) kinda embarrassing. 

I: Yeah.

P: Yeah, my mom and sister trying to, you know, trying to make it work.  The kids didn't have too much of resentment against me.

I: Right, right. And so, did anybody make maintaining those relationships difficult for you?

P: Nope, just myself.

I: Okay. When you say that what do you mean?

P: Uh, [mumbles] maybe like the time the might have been with my wife for a short time you know. I couldn't get a hold of her, she wouldn't have no money on the phone or something you know. That's the only, only thing that as far as me being locked up. Like when I was out for a month or two at a time, I would uh, I would make maintaining the relationship difficult cause I would be using...

I: Oh [positive].

P:..and out running around instead of at home.

I: Okay. You said that, I guess what I was wondering, One of the things that I was curious about is that you said you know maintaining the relationship while incarcerated with them and you said that maybe it was me, (Inaudible) what do you mean by that? Is that because of the just getting locked up in general was part of it?

P: Um, I think I was, I was taking about more when I was out.

I: Okay.

P: Yeah.

I: Alright. Did your children, when they came to visitation or what have you um did they ever question why you couldn't come home? Or were they confused by the situation?

P: Um not, my mom and sister talked to them a lot, you know what I mean. They told them you know, "Daddy's got in trouble, he's going to be gone for a while". Only one time that was difficult was like, like when I was in county just this last time. I was there two months and I, I thought I was getting out sooner you know. Telling me I'm might be getting out by Christmas and that would make me all happy, you know. You find about your court date, they'd come visit, "Daddy, I thought you were getting out." "Oh, it's going to be soon.

I: So that unknown of...

P: Yeah, a little unknown. As long as it was known it was a lot easier on us you know [Inaudible, 1:11:39) the unknown this time was kinda...

I: And was that the time, term that you spent in jail on this case?

P: Yeah, yeah.

I: Okay, aright.

P: So I was hoping to get out a little sooner but things didn't go quite right.

I: So what do you mean? What happened?

P: Oh I wind up going to, I hired a, my attorney didn't show up for trial and stuff.

I: Oh so it's the legal aspect?

P: Yeah. So I was going to go to trial and then my attorney didn't show up and you know I hire a new attorney and end up (Inaudible) so I ended up eventually taking the deal but it took a little longer.

I: Okay, alright. [pause] Did you ever come up with a plan or formulate a strategy to, to uh, parent while you were away, while you were incarcerated? Is that something that you thought about at the time or?

P: Um, you mean as far as trying to plan on being a parent when I got out or being a parent inside?

I: Uh, while you were away. Yeah.

P: Um, you know, yeah uh, I tried to write the kids once a week and do little, get them a card drawn once a week and uh you know, call then once a week and try to stay in contact like that, you know.

I: So you had and active plan of how you would..

P: Yeah.

I: Okay.

P: I try to get myself to write them once a week you know. It's kind of hard to write kids, it's kinda hard, things in there that just hard to write. I force myself just to write a little something to them once a week.

I: Right.

P: It's real hard to write to kids, really not much you can [laughs] much you can say you know.

I: Yeah. Its got to be tough.

P: Yeah. 

I: Do you think it was, that plan to stay in that weekly contact of various methods, do you think that was successful in maintaing a relationship with them?

P: Yeah I think it helped.

I: Okay.

P: Yeah, yeah. It definitely helped.

I: Can you speak to the emotional state of your, for your children while you were incarcerated? Was you know, maybe were they, did they express emotions of you know happiness, loneliness, sadness, things like that that you can attribute maybe to that?

P: Um. Like I said, my mom and my sisters did real good raising them so that part, they were always, you know like when I talked to them they were always like, "Dad, we wish you were home" you know so it was sad as far as missing me and not having me in their lives but they were happy and clung more to my sister and mom cause they were always around so.

I: Okay. I'm gonna, we're going to move into the post incarceration. So more of the current time now and talk about kind of, what's going on with you now.

P: Okay.

I: So right now you live with your children, with your mom and your sister right?

P: Yeah.

I: So there's, there's five of you right?

P: Yeah.

I: Right, okay. And um, what is your, or what is or what has been the greatest parenting challenge for you after living with them now?

P: Um probably, probably my oldest boys respect, probably. You know um, like I said he just wants to see me stay out and do good. Like said before these last couple times he's been at the age where he knows, at the age where he, I don't him I'm going to stay out and do good and I end up going back so now, it's at the point now where I have to prove it.

I: Right.

P: So there's not really much I can say cause every time I try to say you know, I'm your dad you need to do this, you aint been around the last 20 you know, you ain't been around 20 years, you've been in prison the whole time, how are you going to tell me what to do? You know so, I have to, I don't tell him too much cause I want to earn his respect.

I: Okay.


P: The little one like I said he's a little, he's still at the age where he's you know, his dad, the oldest boy you know he's at the age where I need to gain his respect.

I: Okay. And so when did you come out on the ACS program?

P: Um, I think December 22nd, December 22nd, 27th...

I: So you've been out for about 3 months now?

P: Yeah, about 2 and a half months.

I: Okay.

P: [Under his breath] December, January, February. Yeah 2 and a half months.

I: Okay. Alright. Um, has there been anything in prison that prepared you for parenting once you were released?

P: Umm, no. No um, you mean like parenting classes and all that stuff?

I: Um hum [positive]

P: There was, there was no, [pause] prison uh, prison is a bunch of sitting around doing nothing [laughs]. They don't, they don't, there's not a lot offer of that kind of stuff in there.  You pretty much want to do something like that you oder your own book and, or go to the library maybe and check out a book and, but yeah.  Prison isn't uh, isn't. A lot of people probably hear that prison is like rehabilitation and they teach you, teach you uh trades and prison aint like that.  Prisons uh, pretty much you sit in your cell and uh [laughs] any reason they can find to cancel yard or cancel something you're going to that means less work for them, they just keep you in your cells.

I: RIght.

P: Yeah, their ain't all those classes and all that.

I: Right.  Okay. Um, is there any program that you helps your parent that you're active in today.

P: Uh, [sigh] no, no uh, I read some books on my own. I just read some recently this time in and uh [pause] I don't know of any classes or anything like that. Pretty much I just read books and uh, that's about it.

I: Okay. If there was some type of program for parenting would it you be interested in?

P: Um, yeah probably.

I: Okay. Alright. Um, did your mom and your sister make it easy or difficult for you upon release?

P: Oh easy, definitely.

I: Okay.

P: Yeah. I've always had every chance, you know.  My mom make sure I got my car, insurance, a cell phone and everything I needed to stay clean and um, like I said you know, early ages not as much you know [pause] the early ages before my kids, I'd just get out go to my grandmas and run around and d what I wanted but, ever since my kids have were around my mom's just been raising them, trying to get me back to home, and keep me on the right track.

I: Okay. Would you say that you are co-parenting now?

P: That's like um?

I: Team parenting.

P: Huh?

I: Team parenting.

P: Oh like with my mom and sister like, yeah.  Yeah, I uh, like I said they have their routines and I don't interfere with the mornings. My sister has a, a routine for them. She does, she gets them ready for school, gets their backpacks and does their homework with them and all that.  And I'm more, when they're done doing their chores and their homework and all they stuff they do and then, they come visit with me. [laughs] I'm not uh, I'm not involved in uh, you know getting them ready for school or getting them ready for bed, none of that. 

I: [Interjecting] So, I'm sorry go ahead.

P: My sister and mom wash the clothes and do their dishes and their meals and make sure their teeth are brushed and all that.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: This is more of a get used to being around, getting them used to being around me. You know, playing some games on my cell phone or going out in the yard and riding bikes and stuff like that but.

I: So you, earlier we talked about a plan for parenting while you were away. It sounds like you also maybe have a plan, you recognize that you have to build that relationship up...

P: [interjecting] Oh, yeah.

I: ...so it's a process right?

P: Yeah.

I: Um, and so who would you say uh, I think I know the answer to this but I need you to, what do you-. Who do you think the primary caregiver is for your children right now?

P: My mom and sister.

I: Between those two whose primary.

P: [sigh]  My mom probably does more uh in the area of paying the bills. My sister's, my sister does their homework with them and gets them ready in the mornings and does pretty much does their, she's more of the mo-, the uh. I mean both of them, don't get me wrong, both of them do a lot with them before but um, say for instance if my mom and sister ar both there, my sister is going to be the one...

I: Okay.

P: ...to uh, get them to do their homework and stuff like that.

I: Okay.

P: But she's not always there so, when she aint my mom. Yeah if their both there my sister's the one that is kind of, kind of more their mom.

I: Okay. How has your relationship with your children changed over time?

P: Um with the youngest not too much, the oldest he's, he's lost respect for me.

I: Right.

P: He's lost respect for me and he don't uh he don't believe uh, I mean he's uh, I have to prove to him that I'm going to stay out before he'll start respecting me.

I: Okay. Would you say that your children were better off, are better off with you now than while you were in custody?

P: Yes. 

I: Okay. What um, and give me a reason or example that uh...

P: Um if I'm in custody and uh, they want to go for a bike ride with their dad, they can't go on a bike ride with them.

I: Right.

P: Um, um, I mean I'm not a bad, I'm not a bad parent at all I mean I don't, I don't, I don't yell at the kids really I don't spank or nothing like that so um it's good for me to be there with them.  If I'm locked up you know it's they want to do things with me, this and that I can't do it so.

I: Yeah. Okay so just being there.

P: Yeah.

I: Do you find parenting stressful?

P: Oh yeah. [laughs[ Shoot man, if it wasnt for my mom and sister, I don't know. When it comes time for um, me I'm too easy. I'm not used to dealing with them so if they do something wrong in front of me, I'm probably going to say don't that and they do it again.  My mom or sister you know, their going take away whatever their doing wrong. "You can't be playing with this" or "I told you not to, your losing your ds for the week". Like that you know, you know me I'm just gonna, I'm not that, definitely don't have the parenting skills like that. [laughs] Yeah. I'm, I'm more relaxed, even in jail I'm a real calm person so I dont get their the (Inaudible, 1:23:15) aint there that my mom and sister have. [laughs]

I: Right.  And do you think the stress that you experience, the parenting stress that you experience, do you think that's normal or typical for all parents as far as the level of stress you're experience?

P: Oh yea.

I: Okay.

P: Yeah.

I: And so when you run into some of these stressful events in parenting, who do you turn to for advice?

P: Uh my mom and my sister.

I: Okay.

P: Yeah, my mom and sister got their rules with the kids and stuff and they kinda keep you know, make sure they're running straight on track, if they're not then um, they're the ones that make sure things are dealt with.

I: Okay, um. I have a could open ended questions. I don't know, I didn't tell you this at the begining and I apologize but I, this is, you're my second interview in this study and so um, there might be things in here that uh we need to work on and stuff like that. I think I said something in the begining about if there was adjustments or anything...

P: Yeah.

I: So I'm gong to go through a couple questions here um related to that and so if you can think of anything let me know.

P: Alright.

I: So, is there a question you think that I should have asked and didn't?

P: Um, [pause] no I think you got, I think you run past pretty much everything.

I: Okay, alright. Um, is there anything more that you'd like to add that maybe you know, about that, the consequences of your incarceration on your ability to be a parent? Or, or to access a parenting role or anything like that I mean anything that I've missed that maybe you thought of while we were talking?

P: Um, [pause] Only thing I can think of, as far as maybe uh, if I could have been a better parent or something like that would be uh. Something, kinda like what they're doing now, with the, with the system, I mean I'm not blaming the system for what I did, I'm just saying if there would have been more help for addiction um, I think I could of uh, uh, been around for my kids a lot more.  I mean, I'm not saying I didn't do anything to go to prison...

I: Um hum [positive]

P: ...I'm just saying like now I did the same, worse things than I did back then and I'm, I'm at home with my kids you know, so I'm just, uh, if there was more uh, I mean the system is what it was back then but, I think I could've been a better parent had uh, cause I, I did try sometimes but it's just, it's just, it's making it sound like I'm blaming the system but if it would have been more help for addicts, especially young ones.

I: Um hum.

P: Like there is now, I think I would have been a lot better. Would have been better for my kids as far as seeing me more you know me being around them and them changing my  life...

I: Okay. Uh, I'm not going to judge you so.

P: Yeah, I know (Inaudible 1:26:18) taking interviews but. You got a lot of people that been in a long time you blame the system you know. I'm not blaming the system uh,, it just uh, I mean it is what it is.  I was lost and uh I never had to change. I mean I am now because it's giving me a chance, I could be in prison right now and it's giving me a chance to be with my kids and I think I'm making a lot of progress so yeah uh, I'm very thankful for this program they got, the ACS program and the help their giving with these officers are really awesome, giving us help and giving us time. Like today you know, I'm going to go to Chico, put in an application for Rush cause they're giving me an extra little pass (Inaudible) guys in the program and try to get some jobs and.

I: Okay. Um, so what kind of questions were you expecting me to ask?

P: Uh, pretty much the ones, pretty much the ones you asked.

I: Okay. Well, yeah. Sometimes when we do this um, we have uh, I'm going to go ahead and turn this off now that we are done with the interview but uh, just a few other things...
