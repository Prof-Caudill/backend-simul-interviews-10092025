P: We came out here in 72 the first time.

I: Okay.

P: And we moved-, we traveled back and forth from Tennessee to California.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: My dad, my mom and dad would pick fruit you know. 

I: Okay.

P: We traveled all over the United States picking fruits for uh, uh Montana, Oregon, Washington, just all over picking fruit.

I: Did you like that?

P: Yeah it was fun.

I: Okay.  Fruit sounds good right about now. Um, so what did your parents do for a living?

P: Um, my dad is disabled.  Well he was a construction until he fell off a roof and broke, broke his hip.  He had to have a hip replacement.

I: Okay. 

P: Yeah.

I: My mom she was a, she was a stay at home mom.

I: Okay. And your parents were together?

P: Yeah they were together all their life.

I: Okay.  Looking back to your youth um, do you think your family was lower, working, middle, or upper class?

P: Uh, lower. I'd say lower class.

I: Okay.  Why would you say lower class?

P: Because we were always moving and you know we didn't really have, have things like a lot of kids do now you know. 

I: Sure.  What are your parents educational levels.

P: Um, I really don't know.

I: Don't know.  Do you think they made it through high school? 

P: I, I, um no because my mom was uh 16 and my dad was 15 whenever they got married so.

I: Okay. And how many siblings do you have?

P: I have eight brothers and sisters.

I: And where do you fall in that line?

P: Um, I'm next to youngest.

I: Okay, cool.  Were you raised religious?

P: Yeah Baptist. 

I: Baptist.  Okay um, are you religious now?

P: Yeah I still read the Bible and you know, go to church every once in a while. 

I: Okay. We're going to start with your childhood and then we're going to move up into your adolescence and adulthood years.  It probably seems a little strange that we're talking about your childhood now, but in the end it will all make sense.

P: Okay.

I: Um, so when I say tell me about your childhood? What's the first thing that kind of pops into your head?

P: Um, well really traveling back and forth with my mom and dad.  I, I remember a lot of that but much of the rest of it you know uh I quit school when I went, uh, when I hit ninth grade, or tenth grade and I went to work cause I had a kid born when I was 15 so.

I: Okay.  That was your first kid?

P: Yeah. 

I: Okay.  Would you say you, you were a happy child? A sad child? A lonely child?

P: I was happy. 

I: Happy.

P: It wasn't lonely; there were plenty of, plenty of other kids around [chuckles].

I: Plenty of other kids around [chuckles]. Sure.  Okay.  Um, who raised you?

P: My mother and my father both.

I: Okay.  Um, you've answered that.  What kinds of challenges did your parents face raising you and your siblings?

P: Um, well we like I said we didn't really.  My mom and dad didn't really have that much money you know but uh, we was always going to flea markets on the weekends for the, for, for them to make ends meet. So I think it was kind of rough on them.

I: Okay. Did you have a good relationship with your parents as a child?

P: Yes I did.

I: Okay.  Yeah.  And would you consider them good role models for parenting?

P: Yes, I would.

I: Okay. Were you an easy kid?

P: No, I wouldn't say I was easy [chuckles]. No, I was getting in trouble at that early age. 

I: Yeah.  Okay.  Um, just legal trouble or just trouble around the house, at school?

P: Uh, at school uh, I got in trouble at the school for possession of marijuana when I was fourteen.

I: Okay. 

P: Young and quit going to school when I was 15 and started working.

I: Um hum [positive]. Okay.  Um, punishment.  If at all, how did your parents punish or discipline you?

P: Um, we would get our butts spanked or you know, we'd be made to stand in the corner or hold our hands above our head and wiggle fingers, you know.

I: Um hum [positive].  And do you think that was a fair punishment? Now looking back?

P: Now looking back, yeah I do. Yeah I think if they would have been a little more strict or a little more stern I, you know maybe I wouldn't have turned out as bad as I did you know. Uh, but then I lost my dad when I was 18 so.

I: Okay. Most of us have been embarrassed by our parents, one time, or many times.  Um, do you remember a point in your childhood, elementary school age when you felt embarrassed by your parents?

P: No.  No I remember my dad coming up when I was getting jumped by a bunch of, by a bunch of boys and them boys just taking off scattering like flies you know.  Which were like you know, it, it didn't embarrass me, it made me feel good because he did you know, showed up and saved me [laughs].

I: How old were you here?

P: I was like um, I don't know, eleven twelve years old.

I: Okay. Did you like elementary school?

P: Yeah, I guess I did cause I had friends in elementary and I tried to go to school but I was in special ed so it was kinda.  That's the one thing that really you know got me down whenever I was younger was because I was in special classes.

I: Um hum [positive].  Okay. Um, so what, do you remember what your friendships were like?

P: Well I've still got one friend that I've had since fifth grade, you know.

I: Okay.

P: I've known him all my life, we're real good friends.

I: Um hum [positive].  And do you remember a teacher that you really connected with?

P: Um, no.  I didn't really like my teachers too much.  I put tacks on their chairs or [laughs].

I: [laughs].  Okay. 

P: I was one of the guys that was a bully to the teachers.

I: Um hum [positive].  Um, so moving right along to your teenage years.  You kind of touched on those a little bit.  Um, tell me about your teenage years. 

P: Well my teenage years I really didn't.  I don't really remember them all that much because it was like once I hit thirteen, fourteen, fifteen and it's like you know I started working and you know I, I had to grow up faster than 

I: Your friends?

P: Yeah.

I: Where did you work?

P: Well I cut wood, I done construction, whatever I could find you know and then on the weekends I would go to the flea markets with my dad and sit up on the flea market and sell stuff, you know.

I: Okay. Um, did you, so you said you had a kid, your first kid at 15?

P: 15.

I: Did you live at home?

P: No. Uh, I didn't live at home.  I don't know I was living here and there and, doing whatever I could to support that kid.

I: Um hum [positive]. Alright.  Would you, how did you feel as a teenager?  Happy, sad, lonely?

P: Well it was, I was happy I guess you'd say uh, [pause] I really don't.  Like I said, I really don't remember too much.

I: Okay. Um, so why don't you remember it too much?

P: I just don't remember it.  Too much drug use throughout my life, probably. 

I: Um hum [positive].  Yeah. Alright.  Who was most important to you in your life at this point as a teenager?

P: Um, my mom and my dad both. 

I: Okay.  And what was most important to you?

P: Well I looked up to my dad because he was, he was always there for me. So was my mother.  But after my dad passed away, my mom was the only one that was really there and you know she was always there until she passed away

I: Um hum [positive].

P: And she passed away in '05 and it's like she was always there for me.

I: Um hum [positive].  Right.  So do you still keep in touch with all your siblings?

P: Yeah I still, still get to keep in touch with them.  

I: Are they local at all?

P: Um, all of them except for my sister Angie and my sister Charlotte.

I: Okay.

P: Yeah, there's only two of them that's not in California.

I: Okay, good. Um, so as a teenager you said you quit going to school at 14?

P: 15. 

I: 15.  Um, before you stopped, did you like school?

P: No, cause I was in special ed classes.

I: Okay. And what did you do, did you any extra curricular activities after school?

P: No, I...

I: Sports or anything?

P: No.

I: What would you typically do after school? 

P: I would go home and work around my mom and dad's place or I'd you know go out and run around and go fishing.

I: Okay.  Um, and you said you had to grow up quickly, but who would you say was raising you at this point?

P: My mom and my dad. 

I: Okay.  Um, it is going to seem a little repetitive but um, would you say you are an easy or difficult teenager?

P: Um, I, well [pause] I was probably easier than. Than most kids as teenager cause you did listen to my parents but I was still out you know working and making my own way.

I: Okay.  If you got in trouble at this point how would the discipline you?

P: Um, they wouldn’t discipline I would run, I would take off if I got in trouble you know.  I'd just disappear for a while.

I: Um hum [positive]. How did, how was it when you came back?

P: They would want me to go to my room or you know, I'd get hollered at you know.

I: Okay.  Um, how do you think things in your life would been different today had you been able to do all of the things you wanted to do as a teenager?  

P: Um well.

I: Or were you able to do all of the things you wanted to do?

P: I was pretty much able to do everything I wanted to do even as a teenager you know um

I: Pretty independent.

P: Yeah. 

I: Did you get in trouble a lot as a teen?

P: No I didn't really get in trouble until I, until I hit my, um [pause] I don't remember exactly when I started to get in trouble you know, and going to jail and stuff but um, when, I never went to juvenile hall or anything like that whenever I was a teen you know, so.  I pretty much stayed out of trouble.

I: Alright, good. It sounds like you were busy.  Um, what was your relationship with people in authority when you were a teenager? Other people aside from your parents?

P: Um, I didn't really have any authority in my life other than my mom and dad whenever I was you know, growing up.

I: Looking back on these years, were there any events or series of events that changed how you look, thought about yourself?

P: Um, no not really.

I: Or how other people thought of you?

P: Um, my use of marijuana would probably be one of the things that had a bad outlook on me, you know because I smoked, smoked weed when I was younger.

I: Um hum [positive].  Did all of your friends smoke weed as well?

P: Yeah.

I: Yeah, okay. Um, what did, did people say anything when you dropped out of school?

P: Well uh, one of the reasons I did drop out of school was because I couldn't read or write very well you know and I was in the special ed classes and stuff.

I: Um hum [positive].  So in early adulthood, um, or I guess when you had your first child, what was your relationship like, like with your child's mother?

P; Um, well at first it was good and then uh, her grandma, grandpa moved her out of state

I: Okay.

P: And I, it just went I didn't have no contact with her until she was almost 11 years old. 

I: Okay.

P; And then my son TJ was born, but I had my other two step kids there which was Bobby and Jamie.

I: Right.  Okay and how about Bobby? Or excuse me, TJ?

P: Me and him are real close, still today.

I: Okay.  Did you, what was your relationship like with his mother?

P: Uh it was good until I found out she was messing around with somebody else and i left her and then I was with another woman for life 5 years, you know. Just from one woman to another and then I got married and now I got three more kids, you know so.

I: The three younger ones?

P: Yeah.

I: And so, at what point, do you remember which child, at what point when you first got in trouble and went to jail, you were away from your kids?

P: Um that would be, um, TJ would be the one that I was really you know I was real close with him and I ended up going to jail and his mom lost my house and I lost my Harley and all kinds of stuff then.

I: Um hum [positive].  Do you remember how old he was, about?

P: Um, he was probably 9.  8 or 9.

I: Okay.  And what did you get in trouble for?

P: Um, let's see it was cultivation.

I: Okay.

P: Marijuana.

I: And were you, go to prison or jail?

P: No I just went to jail.  I was in jail for a year.

I: Okay, that's not fun.  Um, then you got out after a year and you lost your Harley and you lost your house, what did you do?

P: I went back to work and uh, I went to work as a security guard.  Um, I was trying to get custody of my kids back then and two of my kids were taken, or three of my kids were taken and adopted out and um, Uh, I kind of went off the deep end.  Went back into drugs and..

I: Um hum [positive].

P: Just you can't go through life on drugs, that's for sure.

I: Yeah.  So you talked about your step kids as well were adopted out?

P: Uh none of my step kids were adopted out.  Only three of my, my son Ryan, my daughter Chrystal, and my daughter Nellie.

I: Okay and how old were they when they got adopted?

P: Uh, six, seven, and eight.

I: And CPS took them?

P: Yeah.

I: Why did CPS take them?

P: Because their mother had them in a place where it wasn't, it had no running water.  I wasn't in the picture and that's whenever I had left their mom.

I: And so they, the three of them have the same mother?

P: Uh, they, they yeah.  I have five with the same mother.

I: Okay.

P: That would be Bobbie and Jamie’s step mom. Bobbie and Jamie's mom and then the five of TJ, Chrystal, John, Ryan and Nellie.

I: Okay. 

P: that would be their mom.

I: Okay.  And where were you at this point?

P: Um, I was here all along.

I: And they were here as well?

P: Yeah.

I: Did she not let you see them?

P: No, I was able to see the kids but you know I wasn't.  I wasn't living at the house with them and yeah. She, we were split up.

I: Okay and um, were you doing drugs at this point?

P: Yeah. 

I: What was your drug of choice?

P: My drug of choice was marijuana.

I: Marijuana.  Okay.  Um, can you describe to me how it felt to be a parent?

P: It was great. 

I: Yeah. 

P: It was really. It was a good thing.

I: Were you able to see your kids being born?

P: Yup.

I: Yeah.

P: All of them.

I: All of them, wow.  Did you want to be a parent?

P: Yeah, that was the most important thing to me in my life was being a parent.

I: Parent.  When you found out you were going to be a parent at 15, what was your feeling?

P: I was scared and excited all at the same time.

I: Um hum [positive].  Um, and so how, explain to me kind of your kids situation, right now.  You have the three youngest that are with you.

P: Yeah.

I: And you have your wife of five years. Okay. And your other kids, some of them are pretty grown up?

P: Yeah they're all grown up. 

I: They're all grown up, are they living on their own?

P: Um, yeah.  My son Ryan has his own place. Uh, my son John I don't know where he's at, he's running from the law. Uh, my son TJ he just got out of prison, he's living with my stepson Bobbie. Uh, my daughter Chrystal has her own house.  My daughter Nellie has her own house, she's got a newborn baby.  Um, Katie she lives in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  She has uh, four kids of her own, she lives on the air force base back there.

I: Oh wow.

P: Yeah.  Um, Bobbie and Jamie they have their own places. One's married to an Indian, Jamie she's married to an Indian up here on the reservation. Um, so there all doing rather good I'd say.

I: For the most part.  Um, the two that were getting in trouble, what did they get in trouble for?

P: Um, one got in trouble for stealing, one got in trouble for fighting, you know.

I: And how did that make you feel when you found out they were getting in trouble?

P: Well, it kinda made me feel like they following in my footsteps, the way I done for a while, for a long time, you know.  I was using drugs and they started using drugs and running, running the streets and so that's what go them caught up also, you know.

I: Um hum [positive].  Did they see you using drugs?

P: Yeah.

I: As they were growing up? Yeah.  Do you remember having to have a conversation with them about why you were going away to jail or prison?

P: Yeah, I would tell them straight up. I'm going, I'm in trouble for drugs, you know.  I wouldn't lie to my kids, I'd never lie to my kids, I still don't lie to my kids today.

I: Um hum [positive].  And uh, when you were incarcerated, how did you keep in touch with your kids?

P: Uh I would write them letters or their mom would bring them to see me, you know.

I: Okay, were you um housed?

P: Which?

I: What institution?

P: Uh, well whenever I was in prison, um, I didn't, I didn't get to see my kids.  I was, I, I would write them letters.

I: Okay.

P: They would write me back.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: Um, I was housed in Tracy, in uh, in uh Jamestown in um, Soledad uh, I've been to five or six different prisons you know it's like. It's something I'm not proud of you know. Um, something I don't want to do again.

I: Right. Fair enough.  Um, would you say you are a good parent?

P: I would say I'm a better parent than I was when I was younger.  

I: Yeah, why is that?

P: Because I, I'm able to talk to my kids and I don't do drugs anymore. Uh, I don't drink anymore so it's like, I know I'm a better parent than I was when I was younger.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: You know, for my others, other kids.  Um, I'm able to be there for my kids you know. Uh, whenever I got arrested this time I was being stupid, I was drinking and ended up uh, going to jail for violation of probation and uh, got out on ACS which is a good thing because it, this program is helping me a lot.

I: To be with your kids.

P: Yeah.

I: Um, how would you compare how you parent to how your parents raised you?

P: Um, I wouldn't say that. I would say that I'm a good parent, but not as good as my parents were, you know.  But um, now that I'm clean and sober I would say that I'm as good as my mom and dad was whenever they were, they were around.

I: Okay. Would you describe yourself as an active parent with your older children?

P: Yeah, I’m active with my older children too.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: I was always around, you know, they know who I am, I was always in their life, yeah. 

I: Okay. Do they all call you dad?

P: Yeah.

I: Okay.  Um, and now I'm just gonna try and get a better understanding of your incarceration history, just the time, so we can get the time periods down of kind of when you were able to be with your kids.  Um, briefly walk me through your incarceration history.  So you first went to county for a year for cultivating, 

P: That was, that was in uh, early '90.

I: Okay. 

P: And then I didn't get into any trouble until like '98- '99.  And then I ended up going to prison in '01.  And I done two years in prison in '01 from '01-'03.

I: Is all this for cultivating?

P: No um, for in '01 when I went to prison it was for driving or taking of a vehicle unlawfully.  Somebody owed me some money and I went and beat the crap out of him.  Took their truck, made them sign their truck over.

I: Um [positive].

P: Um, and then my violations, I kept on going back on violations.  Uh, for uh, like dirty tests. Dirty for Marijuana, dirty for meth. 

I: Um hum [positive]

P: Um, other than that I've only done one prison term and I've done two years in the county for uh, child support.

I: Okay.

P: Um, where my ex was drawing welfare and I was living in the home at the time, whenever she was drawing welfare and uh, they wanted me to pay child support.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: Which I was, I was in the home you know so I didn't understand why they wanted me to pay child support.  So whenever I got arrested for child support, uh they gave me a year minus a day and then three days before I was due to get out the took me back to court and gave me another year minus a day so it was like two years in the county and then during that two years that I was in the county, my kids were taken from their mother...

I: Okay.

P: Um, three of them adopted out you know, so it's like that, that drove me off the deep end whenever I got out.  I just went through running, doing drugs again.

I: Sure.

P: Um, so pretty much most of my life uh, it was just. I never really done any prison time or anything like that, or major jail time it was just over...

I: Kicked back for violations.

P: Yeah.

I: Okay, um, When did you find out that your kids were first being, were taken?  Were you in jail or were you out?

P: I was in jail. 

I: Um, did she tell you?

P: No the CPS called, contacted me while I was in jail and uh, so they were detained and.

I: About how old were they? 

P: Uh, they were six, seven, eight, nine, and ten. 

I: Okay.  um, and so were you.  Are you able to contact them now?

P: Yeah, I'm in touch with them now.

I: Okay, but not when they were first in the system.

P: When they first, well I was able to write them letters, I wasn't able to see-.  Well in fact CPS did bring the kids in to see me.

I: Okay.

P: They brought them to the jail to see me while I was incarcerated.

I: Um hum [positive].  And how did that make you feel?

P: It made me feel terrible. 

I: Yeah.

P: You know cause I didn't really, I didn't really want my kids to see me behind jail, behind bars, you know or locked up.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: And uh, that's what, that's why now whenever you know, when I went to jail this time, it really tore me up to have my kids come to see me while I was locked up because they didn't do nothing but cry and pitch a fit on their mom while I was locked up.  You know I was only locked up 70 days but it, it was hard on them, real hard on them.

I: Um hum [positive].  And was that the first time your were separated from your younger kids?

P: Yeah. And the last time too [chuckles].

I: Sure. Okay.  Um, did you find it was more helpful to you to have your kids come visit you?  Or do you think it was, made it worse?

P: Well actually it made my time go, go by quicker um, I know it was hard on them, hard on me too because you know I love  my wife and my kids and it's something that really, it really did down me but it made me feel better.  It made my time go quicker.

I: Um hum [positive].  And you were incarcerated, in prison previously um, were you able to think about your children throughout the day?

P: Oh yeah.  I had pictures of them that my, my ex would send me pictures of the kids.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: I always write them letters and stuff throughout the day.

I: Did they write back?

P: Um, no I didn't get letters back but I still wrote.

I: You knew.  Okay.  And were you able, did they call you often?

P: No, I wasn't able to call or anything.

I: Okay.  [pause]. Did your parents, your children's parents, mothers, make it easy for you to maintain your relationships with your kids? Or did they make it more difficult?

P: Yeah, they wanted me to be in their lives. 

I: Okay.  Um, did you have a plan for how you were going to parent while you were incarcerated?

P: Um, no. I really didn't.

I: Did you have an opportunity to do any parenting classes while you were in prison?

P: No. 

I: And not jail?

P: Uh uh [negative].

I: Do you think that would have been helpful to you?

P: No actually, I, I think I'm a pretty good parent.

I: Okay.  Are you in parenting down here?

P: No.

I: [pause]. Just going through a lot of these we've already touched on.  Um, what has been your greatest parenting challenge?

P: Potty training [laughs].

I: [chuckles] Potty training, is that something you're going through right now?

P: Yeah.

I: With the three year old.

P: Yeah.

I: Okay.  What about with your older children?

P: With the older kids uh, well it was keepin' them in school.

I: Okay.  Did they all graduate? High school?

P: Um, [pause].  All of them but one.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: And he went back and got his GED so it's like, I'm, I'm really proud of my older kids cause they did get their GED's or their high school diplomas.

I: Um hum [positive].  Do you have your GED?

P: Nope.

I: Are you going to work towards it?

P: I'm working on it now.

I: Cool. How's that?

P: Hard.

I: Hard.

P: With me being that learning disabled you know so it's like..

I: It's all on the computer, huh?

P: Yeah.

I: Yeah. Um, [pause].  Are you financially responsible for your children?

P: Yeah. Yeah. I pay the rent and PG &E.

I: Okay, and how about when, when you were incarcerated.  How did it feel not being able to financially provide?

P: It was terrible.  I was afraid my wife was going to lose the house and, and not be able to keep the kids. Um, but my family helped out the where you know, that it did happen that you know, for two months I wasn't able to pay the bills but my family stepped in and helped my wife pay the bills.

I: Okay.

P: So it was like I was, I'm really thankful to my family for that.

I: Um hum [positive]. How has your relationship with your children changed over time?

P: It's gotten better because you know after my kids, after the three were adopted out um, they ran from the, from the adoptive homes and came home.

But it's like I don't have the money to do all that.  But with my younger ones, they've got, they've got everything that they need, you know.

P: Tell me hey, wake up you’re fixing to lose everything, you know.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: So it's like I'm walking a chalk line. [chuckles].

I: Sure, yeah okay.  Um, can you think of anything else that I should ask you about parenting you know the goal is how can, it sounds like you have a pretty solid relationship with your kids and you were fortunate enough for that. But some people who were sent to prison for six years, down south um, maybe don't have that opportunity to be able to be connect with their kids and that's kind of big right?  It was a big issue for you.

P: Well whenever I was incarcerated in prison, in jail and in prison,

I: Um hum [positive].

P: And I wasn't able to be in touch with my kids, the only way, the only thing, you know I went, I, I signed up for the Angel tree and was able to send the Christmas presents and stuff like that.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: Um, so I strongly suggest for people to, to if they can't be there for them, at least send them, or write them letters, you know.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: Uh, do something to get in touch with them.

I:Um hum [positive].

P: You know, that's that's what I'd say you know because it really does it, it grounds that person you know if they're not able to get, be in touch with their kids or family whenever they're locked up. 

I: um hum [positive].

P: So I would strongly suggest for people to be in touch with their loved ones.

I: Okay. What kinds of questions were you expecting me to ask? You don't know.

P: [Laughs]. 

I: So the reason we go through your whole childhood is to kind of see how you were parented and how you are parenting.  It sounds like that had a big effect.

P: Yeah.

I: On how you parent. A very positive effect.  Um, what made you agree to do the interview.

P: It was just uh, Sarah asked me if I wanted to do an interview and I said, "Yeah, sure, why not.
