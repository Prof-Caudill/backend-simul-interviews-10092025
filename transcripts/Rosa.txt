I: Okay, so here we go now it's saying a different folder. But I just have some questions I'm hoping to ask you and like I said, if at anytime you want to stop, we'll just stop and um, if any time you want to talk about something else that's okay too.  Most of them are going to, we're going to start by talking kind of about your life history and um, that sort of thing so, um. Um, first of all these are basic demographic questions so we know a little bit.  How old are you?

P: I'm 30, I just turned 30 in January.

I: Oh, Happy Birthday.  Okay and how do you identify yourself in terms of race and ethnicity?

P: Um, I'm white but I do not know which race.

I: [Laughs] Okay, well that's a good answer. Um and sexual orientation?

P: What do you mean?

I: Um do you like men or women.

P: Men.

I: Okay. [laughs] And have you ever been married or in a domestic partnership?

P: Yes, he's deceased now.

I: Oh, okay.

P: Yeah. He died.

I: Alright, um

P: And I didn't kill him. [laughs]

I: [Laughs] I didn't think that. How long were you together?

P: Uh, 7 years.

I: Okay. And how did he die?

P: In prison he had brain cancer and it killed him so 

I: Oh

P: The medication they had him on.

I: Oh, okay.

P: That's a whole nother ball game.

I: Whole other story. Okay. How long ago was that?

P:  Um, it's been 5 years.

I: Right.

P: He was older. He was 40 and I was 18, 19.  

I: Uh huh [positive]

P: When we got together.

I: Okay. And so you still had a relationship going on when he was in prison.

P: Yeah.

I: And so you had to watch that.

P: And then I was in, I was in, I went to prison when he was in prison and then he got out and then I got out. They day he-, I got out he went back in and died. It was crazy.

I: Oh. 

P: It was a mess.

I: Oh okay. Alright. Um, so you're a parent.

P: Um hum [positive] I have 4 kids.

I: Okay. How old are they?

P: 13, 12, 9, and 5

I: So you were 17 when you had your first?

P: Yup.

I: And you also take care of your sisters child? You were talking about...

P: [interjecting] Um, I got three of her kids. She's, she lives at the house, I live with her.

I: Oh, okay.

P: She works so I help her with the kids and their dad's there to help so.

I: Okay. And you have all four of your kids with you?

P: No, my two boys were adopted when I went to prison and then my middle child, she was uh, she went with her dads family, the one that died. And then I have one with her dad here in town.

I: Okay. Alright. So do you see her much?

P: No not really. He's, he like tries to hold her above my head. Like, we have joint custody and he's tryin' to, "You gotta be with me or else you can't see her". So I'm trying to go back to court and get that taken care of.

I: Okay. Um, I, I really um, on of the things I'm really interested in is um,  what it must have been like to be in prison and not to have access to your kids um.

P: Oh. It's horrible. It's the worst feeling ever. I mean I think they should have some kind of reunification for mothers that you know are young like I was and not know, you know a lot of things in life that was raised not with the, with misled information. I was raised with a lot of misled information basically.  You know I was raised in a drug life, in a drug world um, i never had a chance to know, you know what I mean, what a parent was like so I think they should offer more programs for people you know that's looking at time, with their children you know what I mean. Um, it's just, I mean they break up families so easily and it's not, I don't understand how they could do that you know.

I: Yeah.

P: And I only got in trouble one time. It's not like I did a big ol' crime and I needed to go it was,

I: Uh huh [positive]

P: It was, it was not fair. And I believe if they go to CRC which is a rehabilitation center...

I: Um hum [positive]

P: ...that they should, when they get out they should be able to pick up where they left off in the CPS case you know.

I: Um hum [positive]

P: Instead of them just taking their kids and making them sign over everything because they're incarcerated. Because they are going through rehabilitation. You know what I mean?

I: Um hum [positive]

P: I think they deserve that chance. Now I could understand if it was in prison where they were going for 5 years and not getting out.

I: Uh huh [positive]

P: But CRC is only for 9 months. You know what I mean?

I: Uh huh [positive]

P: So I don't.

I: So when, when you were in prison you felt that the adoptions were kind of forced on you?

P: It was, they told me I had to sign the papers.

I: Who did?

P: The CPD here in Oroville.

I: Okay. Alright. And how old were your kids then?

P: Uh, my sons were uh 3, or 2 uh, wait 3 and, wait 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, one of the 2.

I: Uh huh [positive]

P:Drugs messed up my brain. It's kinda hard to remember you know, dates or ages.

I: Uh huh. Were they, were you with them up until the time you went in?

P: Yes.

I: Okay. So um, you said that you grew up in um, kind of a drug environment.

P: Yeah. My dad, he was um, he used to cook drugs and sell them.  Like every other night we had cops with guns to our head you know living with my dad. And my mom, she didn't use but she lived the lifestyle you know. She'd go collect his money and me and my sisters and my mom was always home alone and people was always knocking on our door for my dad or, you know I mean,  it was really scary.

I: Um hum [positive]

P: There was people there just wantin' to you know. You see it all. I remember one time we lived up in, we lived up in (Inaudible) and the cops kicked in the door and I was like, I think I was 5.

I: Wow.

P: They had a gun to my head, all my sisters head, my mom's, my grandma and grandpas. They had us all on our knees in the front yard.

I: Um hum [positive]

P: In the snow, with guns, looking for my dad cause my dad was you know a very bad guy. Um, my dad escaped from prison before, you know what I mean.

I: Um hum [positive]

P: He was on the top most wanted thing and uh I don't know it's always been like that. I didn't know no other life.

I: Okay. Yeah. I'm sorry.

P: Yeah, so.

I: Um, so I, I don't even know where C**** is. Is that where you were raised?

P: No, we just lived up there for my younger, you know. It's up the mountains right close to here.

I: Uh huh [positive]

P: Like by [inaudible] town, Berry Creek.

I: Oh okay. I know that area. 

P: Yeah. Right there.

I: Okay. So did you grow up in Oroville?

P: Yeah.

I: Okay, alright.

P: Well we traveled like everywhere. One time my mom left my dad when I was like 9 cause he went to prison and she sold everything of ours, we had nothing, all of our clothes, everything.  We went to Utah and she got with an abusive guy and then my dad got out. He came and got us all and brought us back.

I: Uh huh [positive]

P: She was very dysfunctional, you know, she, she would go like, go and leave us there alone. She'd buy us a Lunchable and a soda when the big slams, when they first came out...

I: Uh huh [positive]

P:...and leave us at home in Palermo...

I: Uh huh [positive]

P: ...we lived on a street where it's dark, scary, you know she would leave, she'd lock the dogs in the yard cause the dogs would bite us...

I: Uh huh [positive]

P:... so we couldn't leave and no once could come in and she would just go to (Inaudible, 0:07:50) so we would just be there by ourselves.  When I was like 9.

I: So your dogs were your babysitter, not really.

P: Yeah. My dad would go, my dad would be in prison or running the streets doing drugs whatever and my mom would be at the (?) when it was here downtown.

I: Um hum [positive].  Did you think that it was normal as you were growing up? Did you think that it was a normal childhood?

P:  That's how I was raised. I didn't know no different you know.

I: Uh huh [positive].

P: I mean I would get made fun of in school you know cause we'd have to rush cause my mom would either get home too late and not wake us up, or something so. 

I: So did you go to a lot of schools?

P: Yeah. A lot. She would move us or my dad would move us cause you know if his house got too hot we'd have to move to another place, another place. It was crazy. We seen cops come flying in our driveway chasing my dad. My dad would switch cars and go out the back of drive way.

I: Oh [positive].

P: You know what I mean, in another car and 

I: Uh huh [positive].

P: It was insanity.

I: How, how did you feel, how did you feel about your dad?

P: I used to hate, well I used to, I loved him a lot and...

I: Uh huh [positive].

P:...I always wished that he would just come home every night. I used to sit up and wait for him every night and he never came home. Some days he wouldn't come home for years you know.

I: Um huh [positive]

P: I always though he was coming home. He always told me he would, you know.

I: Yeah. 

P: But my mom always talked bad about my dad

I: Uh huh [positive]

P: And that was, they always fought and I don't know. I always thought that my dad would always be comin' home.

I: Um hum [positive].  And how about your, your relationship with your mother? 

P: My mom is uh, a man pleaser. You know...

I: Oh, okay.

P: ...she's always got to have a man in her life and uh, our relationship now, she's concerned for me you know. She worried about me um, I'm the only one of her children that's been to prison. You know, I'm the youngest of her children, I'm the only one that's got all her kids taken away. Lost everything you know, I got all the bad things happening to me in my life. You know, I got cancer, stomach cancer and um, my mom now lives with another guy that's been abusing her for the last six years. She just got back with him and moved to Utah and left me, you know what I mean, when I got out. 

I: Um hum [positive]

P:And um, (Inaudible, 0:10:13) when she left me. You know what I mean?

I: Um hum [positive]. Um, when did you find out you had stomach cancer?

P: It's been about three years.

I: Uh huh [positive]. So

P: But my mom also left us um, my dad went to prison, my mom got with this guy and he was molesting my sisters and um I used to have to watch it you know. And um, when my dad got out, he got us kids back. [trails off]

I: I'm sorry. This isn't much of a, kleenex.

P: Yeah. It's okay. And my sister, my middle sister the I live with now, she lied on my dad because she was going to counseling at the  school for getting molested and she said that my dad had hit her and threatened her and he didn't.

I: Um [positive].

P: And he was on parole so he go five years you know. And they took us to a foster home and I ran away and stayed on my own since I, I was ten years old.

I: You ran away from home when you were ten?

P: Foster home. 

I: From the foster home. And you were on your own?

P: I wanted to go live with my family. I wanted my, my oldest sister was emancipated. She had a baby and it was me and my other sister that went to the foster home and I ran away.

I: Uh huh [positive]

P: I wanted to be with my sis-, my other sister and um, I found my mom and she uh, told me I could go with her and the guy that molested my sisters cause she married him afterwords, you know.

I: Uh huh [positive]

P: After she found out he molested-, she married him and um she said I could go with them and I told her no and so she spun out, left gravel in my face and drove off to (Inaudible, 0:11:40).

I: Um hum [positive]. And you were ten?

P: Um hum [positive]. And so I just was bouncing around from my sisters to my grandmas to my aunt and they were like you can't be here, you're going to get us in trouble.

I: Huh [positive].  And did you go to school?

P: Um, I was smokin' marijuana then.  Um, hanging out with whoever I could to fit in with, wherever I could to have somewhere to sleep. And then, I went back to school at Oroville adult school.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: Um, cause this one lady, she was taking good care of me, she made me go back to school.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: Her daughter smoked pot and I smoked pot so she let us stay there but we had to go to school.

I: Um hum.

P: And then pot with alcohol and then it, I met a guy which is my fist sons dad, we started doing meth together and then it went from there. I was 16 and it you know progressed.

I: And that was in Oroville?

P: Um hum [positive].

I: Um, alright. So, did your parents ever have any occupations other than your um, dad cooking meth?

P: My mom went back to school, she got her license to be a um, what is it CNA?

I: Uh huh [positive].

P: She was working at Olive Ride. When she um, first got with that guy that molested, was molesting my sisters. When she'd go to work, he'd molest them and I had to watch and stuff and then um, she stopped working for, over here when she moved cause my sisters testified against her husband and-, but he never went to prison for it. He just now went to prison for molesting but they got him for, like 18 different cases and he, he was a property um, maintenance guy here in Oroville.

I: Uh huh [positive].

P: Like a lot of the houses and he was molesting all of the kids.

I: Ohhhh [positive].

P: But they didn't do nothing about our case, you know what I mean. They just, you know let it go and then when all these other cases popped up they got him and now he's locked up but.

I: Okay.

P: That's when my mom moved to the next one, you know [laughs].

I: Uh huh [positive].

P: But..

I: How, how many sisters do you have and how old were they?

P: Two. Um, my, my sister I live with now, she's 31.

I: Uh huh [positive].

P: And I'm 30...

I: Uh huh [positive]. 

P: And my other sister is 33.

I: So,

P: [Interjecting]  She's on the run. My oldest sister, she's, she followed me you know what I mean.

I: Uh huh [positive]

P: She was doing good, she had her kid, you know and duh duh duh and then when I was on the streets and I started bringing bad people to her house, got her involved and then she started, she started using like, I think it was five years ago.

I: Uh huh [positive]. And so she's actively using now?

P: Yeah, she's on the run with the cops and so I don't have no contact with her you know um, I'm trying to better my life but I did, I did write her a letter and tell her that I got to move on with my life, I can you know, sit here and do this no more and you know cause, me and her, we'd go out together like that, together you know what I mean. We used to run together and I just got to keep that out of my life to move on.

I: Um, so, um, I'm just kinda this (Inaudible, 0:14:40). Are you uncomfortable being here?

P: No.

I: Okay.

P: I'm just reading that right there.

I: Oh. What's that?

P: Oh this um, secretly file. I was like, what?

I: Yeah.

P: I thought it said securely. I'm all, huh?

I: Oh no. What we do is um, we have to keep the files separate from anything that would identify you and it's just part of, part of what we do because we want you to be able to feel like you can speak freely and also feel that your not intimidated to speak. Because sometimes when your in a situation like this it almost feels like we're an authority and you need to talk to us but you, you have complete choice.

P: I know.

I: Um, okay, so.

P: I don't mind talking cause it might help someone else you know what I mean. It's out there, it don't know what I mean. My story, I, I always wanted to do my own video for people that's struggling or that's been in that kind of a family.

I: Uh huh [positive].

P: Like for the younger children so they know it's not okay to be raised like that. And you know like schools could play the video of you know how, how I grew up. I could have a documentary made of kids actually playing it out. You know what I mean?

I: Um hum [positive].

P: With my story so they kinda know, it's not okay to do. And it's not okay for your parents to do that to you.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: I also want to do one with my kids, my kids you know what I mean. And how I did my life...

I: Um hum [positive].

P:...and how, and how the system was wrong and how I was wrong. You know what I mean? We both made the wrong, you know what I mean. The system could have helped me but at the same time I could have helped myself too, you know what I mean.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: So people that, younger adults and I mean, the younger kids and the younger adults. The teenagers and stuff like that know, you know what I mean about-. I think schools should start playing those and you know, at least one, one class in every grade they go up.

I: Oh [positive].

P: You know what I mean?

I: To see it as advance or, be kind of age appropriate.

P: Um hum [positive]. Yeah.

I: For, for them.

P: Yeah.

I: I think that would be very powerful.

P: I think it would be a lot um, there would be a lot more kids feeling safer to be able to talk about it.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: To be able to go to a counselor and say, "Hey, this is happening in my home"

I: Uh hum [positive].

P: Um, "I'm just scared, I don't know what to do." You know what I mean? Don't play my whole story at once cause then they'll really be scared. You know what I mean like, "We're gonna get taken away!"

I: Um hum [positive].

P: And stuff like that. But if you just play like each step like I was in 9th grade, or 5th grade, what happened then? And just play that to the 5th graders, you know what I mean?

I: Um hum [positive].

P: And then me saying at the end you know, "It's not okay" you know I, "It led me to prison" not say the whole getting you know taken away and all that cause that's going to scare a kid away.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: Or just scare anybody away, you know.

I:  Um hum [positive].

P: If you tell them what led you to prison when you was 5 years old and how it progressed you know, but you wont to tell them the part about getting taken way cause they may get scared and...

I: Um hum [positive].

P: ...they won't open up.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: I think it would be very helpful. I always wanted to do that.

I: Um hum [positive].  I, I would guess that, I, I mean first of all, maybe there would be something that you would, I'm sure there would be people who would be really interested in working on something like that with you. Um, and so I think that if you were to pursue it um, it, it could be something that could happen and, and maybe help you in terms of going, you know.

P: I think it would help my emotional state and my mental because I go through a lot of mental now with all this and um I believe it will help like me knowing that I'm help-, I may be helping. Even if I don't you know. Just the fact that me might, I might be helping someone or letting everybody know it's not okay. I think it would be, it would help me out too, you know what I mean. As far as my mental or my you know cause I just got so much to offer out there. I mean I go share at meetings. I do everything in my power to do what I gotta do you know. To get by, through everyday clean and sober and um, there's not a moment I don't think of my kids.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: Not one moment goes by that I don't think of them.  

I: Was there ever a time when they were less important to you?

P: No. When I used drugs I was numb you know, after I got them taken um, they got adopted, I went numb. The feeling of not having then and I, you would take your mind off them not, to a, to a certain degree, not, my mind never goes off them, period, all the way.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: But it would take you to where you didn't um, you didn't have that hurt you know what I mean.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: It felt like it was numb.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: And I always thought about them and the things we did. You know like I see other moms with their kids doing things and I'd be like, "Oh, I used to do that," you know, but it didn't really make me cry every time, you know. As of now, I always be like, see them and I cry, you know and I'm like "  " 

I: Um hum [positive].

P: But on their birthdays I always get a balloon and I write a message, a pray-, prayer on it and I let it go in the air.

I: Oh that's sweet.

P: And I keep the little things that go on the bottom of the balloons. 

I: Uh huh [positive]

P: You know those round plastic things and I write their name and year on it.

I: Okay. 

P: (Inaudible, 0:19:43).

I: Yeah. That's, that's really, I mean...

P: [laughs] That's something I have to do uh to make my self get through that time.

I: Um hum [positive]. It's very symbolic.

P: Um hum [positive].

I: Yeah. Did um, I, I know that the stepdad was horrible and awful to you and um, other kids but was there any discipline in your household? Was there-?

P: My mom always cussed at us, called us names and like if you wanted something to eat or something after school she'd just she was evil. You know as far as that one because her and her boyfriend would fight over certain things and I don't know she was just, she was never there really you know, but she was the one we knew.

I: Um hum [positive]. Um did your um parents have any schooling?

P: My mom dropped out of school. She had kids when she was like 14, 15 or something.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: Her and my dad and uh, so my mom just went you know, she quit school and my she just went back like when I was saying, when I was nine or ten. But she's never had no-, my dad never had no school. He's always been in prison all his life, in and out, in and out.

I: Um hum [positive]. And um, 

P: [Interjecting]  My dad went back to school and became an alcohol and drug counselor.

I: Oh okay!

P: Just about ten years, eleven years, maybe twelve years ago and now he's in prison doing life.

I: Oh.

P: Cause he, he was running a rehab. He had his own program, he had everything going for him, he went to school, I got out of prison, I moved in with him. It was like a good relationship, you know. He helped me get off parole and then he started using again and cooking drugs and um, he gave someone a ride and (Inaudible, 0:21:30) murdered someone and my dad went down with the guy.

I: Oh.

P: It's just that easy. You know what I mean? And that, and that's a lot mental thing I go through now is because you know I always wanted that relationship with him, you know.

I: Uh huh [positive].

P: And I finally got it and then he just blew me off like I was nothing.

I: Do you stay in touch with him?

P: I write him every once in a while.

I: Uh huh. Do you ever go see him?

P: I can't. [laughs]. I'm on house arrest.

I: Oh, of course. [laughs].

P: Plus I'm and ex felon, you know.

I: Yeah. No I'm, I'm sorry. I can be really dense. Um, Okay. Um so actually you've talked about a lot of the things that I wanted to um, ask you because you know um, we are interested in parenting so um, did you ever have someone in your life that you though was a good role model to parent?

P: My dad when he got clean. You know what I mean, he's a whole different person, you know what I mean.

I: Uh huh [positive].

P: He was compassionate he um, he was actually the only one who tried to help me get my kid back, you know. Um, after they got adopted he was still trying you know.

I: Uh huh [positive].

P: And uh, but they was like, there was no way, you know what I mean. But the adoption parents would let my dad go see them.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: You know, after they was adopted and, but I couldn't you know what I mean so. I only got to see pictures, you know what I mean and but,

I: Do you still get pictures?

P: No. My dad's not in their life no more. My dad's

I: Oh okay. So that's your two boys, your daughter...

P: She's with her dads family. I see her pictures all the time.

I: Oh good.

P: Yeah. Their family lives all here in Oroville. They live in Texas but I see pictures...

I: Uh huh [positive].

P: She's so big and so beautiful...

I: [Interjecting] How old is she?

P: ...so she's in a Christian home you know.

I: Uh huh [positive].

P: And it's a lady that adopted her and another baby at the same time...

I: Oh.

P: ...and so they grew together and then now the lady that adopted and her daughter, her oldest daughter, her only kids both had a baby together. They both had a baby. At the same (Inaudible) So now they got my, or the two that they adopted and the two new ones so it's like, it's crazy.

I: [Laughs].  Oh.

P: She had an older daughter and then they both end up pregnant I don't know how that happened.

I: Oh, okay.

P: But she's a Christian lady. She's been trying all her life to have her, you know with her new husband.

I: Uh huh [positive].

P: Cause used to be a druggie you know she got, she had her first baby and she stopped everything, the father he kept (Inaudible 0:24:00) so she let him go and she raised the baby on her own. And so she got with this Christian man and they've been trying to have babies for years.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: And it happened but at the same time her daughter got pregnant too so. Yeah I see pictures you know and she's doing good. She's very well mannered I guess. I just hear a lot about her but...

I: Uh huh [positive].

P:...she's so beautiful and I wouldn't take her out of that home, you know what I mean.

I: She's, she's in a good spot and I'm not read right this moment. I don't have my own place, I don't have every thing I want her to have, you know. I, I want my children to have everything I couldn't, I couldn't have you know when I was younger. And right now with my mental state, my um, my case you know, doing this time, um a lot of things in my life, I'm not sure if I'm ready, you know what I mean.  I would take her if something was like to oh here's your kid, oh yeah I would take her and I would get a job or push myself to do the responsible thing but I would not take her out of where she's at just to, just to damage her life, you know what I mean. Cause I don't got everything they got to offer.

I: Do you hope that she'll reach out to you when she's

P: [Interjecting] She will. 

I: She will.

P: Yeah. They tell her about me, they tell her that I'm her mom.

I: Uh huh [positive].

P: And that I was an addict. She knows I'm an addict and that um, that I'm bettering my life. And my, the lady that's got her, her names R***, uh she told me, I call her you know and she's like, "I can't let you talk to her, it's ilegal but I can tell you she's doing good and she knows about you and she knows you've got a disease and we watch books, I mean we read books and we watch movies about addicted parents and she knows what your going through and she wants to meet you someday. You know when she's older and..." You know she kinda unders-, she's very smart. But these guys are raising her in a nice way, you know what I mean.  Like she's going to know about me, it's not that they're going to try to keep her from me or, so um that gives me strength to better my life you know, everyday.  Everyday to know that my daughters going to be here soon, someday when she's 18...

I: Um hum [positive]

P: ...just gives me the hope, you know what I mean, that it is going to happen and it will happen and it's possible, anythings possible through God.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: And I believe that.

I: Did, did you um have any teachers that you really liked in?

P: [Interjecting] We was moving so much.

I: You didn't get to from relationships with the teachers? Okay. Um, what were your friendships like when you were a kid?

P: Short.

I: Short. 

P: I mean really we had to move so much or we wasn't allowed to have people over, or kids over because drugs and like, you know, um, it was really you know, you don't say nothing to nobody. "You admit nothing, deny everything."

I: Um hum [positive].

P: Basically that was what I was raised by and so it kind of.  They couldn't come over and I couldn't go over there and..

I: Um, and so you mentioned something about God. That, was there any religion at all in your upbrining?

P: No.

I: No, Um, and so you told me some about your teenage years. You told me that from time you were 10 onward you were kind of going from place to place and that you husband about 16.

P: Yeah.

I: And that's when you started using

P: [Interjecting] drugs and then um I got a case uh, lying to a police officer cause he went on a high speed chase with me in the car and then he ran and I told the cops it wasn't him it was somebody else and that was my first time ever getting in trouble, was that.  It was just horrible you know you start doing meth and then it just continues you know what I mean.

I: Um hum [positive]

P: It gets worse, your life don't come up you know...

I: Um hum [positive].

P: ...you seem to think you might, you're gonna get more, more, more, but it don't happen that way, you know what I mean.  It takes everything from you um, it gets you to a frame of mind where you don't care who you hurt or how you hurt them or anything.  You know I didn't talk to my sister I live with now, for years.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: She went to the school, she stayed in the classroom, went through school, got a degree you know, she's never done drugs, nothing. She's a good mom, she's a strong woman but she's been to the counseling and uh, and uh every step of things that they have to offer, you know what I mean.

I: Um hum [positive].  Do you feel like you are getting good counseling now?

P: The Sher-, this program I'm on is awesome.

I: Uh huh [positive].

P: Like I got some good counselors and the sheriffs, like yesterday, they said we had this um training, and I'm like training, I don't work for you guys you know. But they took us down there and uh, the lieutenant was there, all of the sheriffs were there, all the counselors um, and a doctor and the doctor sat there and taught us what drugs does to your brain, like the pleasure center, what makes you go out and keep doing it and what a relapse is and what uh, on the other hand of just using one time and you don't put it down is. And he actually showed us compassion you know what I mean and they fed uh Subway, you know what I mean.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: It kinda made me feel more comfortable with them you know being sheriffs you don't do that kind of thing. You don't go have lunch, you don't tell them anything you know. Cause I was raised in a home where you just don't do it and but this programs got so much to offer families and people thats trying to do good and I wouldn't, I wouldn't like it any other way, you know what I mean. It's awesome. It's the most beautifulist thing in the world. I'm like a little kid in a candy store you know, I never got to go to one of those and this is like for me it's like a candy store you know it's like everything I needed help with in my life growing up is all in this one place and it's awesome.

I: Um, It's also nice that you have your sister to live with. I bet that would be really tough...

P: [Interjecting] Yeah. She's very supportive. She knows I'm and addict. She knows what I been through um, she just couldn't um, what was it called, she couldn't uh, basically she couldn't risk her old children you know what I mean. So she couldn't be in contact with me when I was on a run or using and she didn't want to take that chance, you know what I mean. Which I don't blame her, you know, um, she was a school teacher, you know she's doing a lot of good things in her life. So she's very good support.

I: Um hum [positive].  Well she doesn't seem to mind you being with her kids so she

P: [Interjecting] No, she knows me, she knows how good of a mom I was, you know what I mean. It just when I went to prison everything you know, everything, I lost my kids, I couldn't you know, they made me sign over rights so she knows. Like she told her daughter, "Aunt Beth takes good care of you huh?" Cause I get her dressed, take, giver her bath, get her dressed, feed her before I get her dressed you know I get her all ready, nails painted. Cutest little thing and any money I get, which is very limited because I don't have a job, uh like my friends, like my good, like my sponsorship money or something, the first thing I do is take baby to Salvation Army and go get her brand new stuff...

I: Um hum [positive].

P: ...you know some clothes and all that. And I take her with me in the stroller over there and I go shopping with her and then let her help me pick them out you know and, I don't know it's just, it's something I feel I can't do for my own children that I do for my sisters.

I: Um hum [positive]. Um, so, so many of the things that I was going to ask you don't really apply to your life um, and so um, you know I'm just kind of moving through some of these you, one of the things, you said you were a really good mom for those few years with your sons, what was your relationship with them like?

P: It was beautiful. They didin't want me to leave their side you know. I was going to Butte College, I was doing really good um,

I: Uh huh [positive].

P:...cause I went back to school you know um at Oroville Adult School, I got my GED.  

I: Uh huh [positive].

P: I had my first child so I got him and I started going to Butte College with him. You know I was taking him with me there cause he was going to day care, you know. I would go to school, come out, get him, go home, be the mom, you know what I mean. And then, I was pregnant at the same time you know

I: Um hum [positive].

P: when he was born, my second son was born on my first sons 1st birthday. [Laughs] It was horrible...

I: [Laughs].

P: but I went in premature labor because the guy I was dating, not the kids dad cause I left him cause he got real bad into drugs and uh, my son was like 5 months old when I left his father because he started getting abusive, so I just left and I was dating this other guy but he was really mentally, you know, abusive and I mean he was good with my other son but he got into a fight with me and pushed me down and made me go in labor.

I: Uh huh [positive].

P: On my first son's first birthday. So, yeah, it was horrible. My so was life flighted from Oroville hospital to Sacramento. I had to stay here cause I had emergency C-section and it was horrible. It was horrible.

I: Yeah. Um, so you were 19 about the first time you went to jail?

P: Yeah.

I: And you were in for?

P: In and out.

I: Yeah.

P: You know how they put you on the court probation and then uh you fail to do anything else there. They just it's a system, the system I believe um, the way they got it going, you know what I mean, I think it's a whole, honestly, it's a whole bull crap. Their, they don't care about helping people. They don't have the programs they say they do. 

I: Um hum [positive].

P: They say they have all of these programs for us addicts, for people that's struggling but honestly we used to try to go the that program and (Inaudible 0:33:54) and they tell you no, or do you have a referral? 

I: Um hum [positive].

P: Or you have to go to court and ask for it. Or can you pay? You know what I mean. It's not something that they're willing to give you, you know what I mean?  And they want you to do all these steps to get through that to get that one thing that you need that can help you better your life instead of, you know what I mean. Like they said they had all kinds of these classes and I was gonna take them you know to get my kids and before I even went to prison.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: You know when I, not to keep my kids but to stay, you know how I was gonna stay sober basically and they didn't, they wanted me to pay for them and I was a single mom you know raising two children now, it's not something you can do you know what I mean and uh, I don't believe it was fair, you know what I mean.

I: Um.

P: Cause I was on welfare and you need, in order to be on welfare you only got so much, and especially when you got two babies in diapers you know what I mean.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: It's just, it costs a lot, a single parent on welfare and back then it was not as much as you get now. You know welfare wasn't so and the rent was skyrocket. It was horrible.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: I was clean then.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: I was trying to do the right thing and but they wanted me to take a class and I couldn't take the class unless they paid for it and so that's what got me violated so many times in that area.

I: Um  hum [positive].

P: To where, "Okay, you're going to prison" and I'm like [pause], you know. So it's not like I had a chance to you know the system as far as that goes but it is what it is.

I: So you went back to prison on the violation

P: Eh uhh [negative].

I: No?

P: My whole prison sentence was a violation of probation.

I: Right.

P: Because I couldn't meet their criteria that they said was so free, you know what I mean.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: Which is not okay. You know what I mean?  If I would have known that I probably would have never signed up for it and I would have went (???) and I would have signed parental rights over to my dad cause he was sober then. I woulda did 90 days all together and I woulda got out with nothing. No probation, no parole and I woulda had my kids and you know, so long. But they said, "Be on probation" and duh duh duh and just take this class, "Oh take this class?" That'll help me in my recovery and what I need to do to better myself you know cause my dad was like no, I think you need some kid of strings attached to you so you don't just get free and go back you know. Cause addiction is uh is a bad thing and your mind is always going to think about it cause it's had that pleasure one time.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: Cause my dad was a counselor so he taught me that so I was like okay. So I was thinking, "Yeah okay. This is going to work out" but you have to pay for it all.

I: Yeah. I always hear just really how addictive meth is, you know.

P: You know every drug's addictive, every drug. 

I: Every drug?

P: Marijuana, I thought I'd never give it up. But once I hit the other stuff it was like oh wow, okay, I don't need that no more but before I couldn't go without marijuana either. But it's a, it's a ugly disease. It's ugly. I wouldn't, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy and I don't have none of those you know what I mean. But I would not want nobody ever to try it or to do it.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: Its taken so much from me. It's never give, not once given me anything back.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: You know what I mean?

I: Um hum [positive].

P: So. 

I: Okay. Um, so. So you haven't seen any of your kids since they were taken away except your one daughter whose here.

P: Um and I had her when I got out of prison, I got, I went to the Skyway House Rehab.

I: Okay.

P: Okay. I did the whole program, graduated.

I: Uh huh [positive].

P: And I met her, my daughters father during that time and uh, he got me my got at parks and re-City of Oroville...

I: Oh.

P:...I was on parole working for the City of Oroville and then we got together and I got pregnant and then he uh, got a power trip you know, "Okay, well you're gonna start giving me all your checks" and I'm like, "What?" and I'm working you know and uh I was like wait a minute, for what? He's wantin to save it to buy another car. We got a brand new Honda Civic, you know what I mean. Brand new, from the lot and I'm like no, no It's not gonna, we gotta keep, we gotta start saving money for her and I was going to Butte College, working full time and taking a kid with me everywhere I went. And he was just sitting at home being an umpire what, every other day or whatever. It's nothing you know umpiring's nothing, but he didn't watch my kid when I had to work all night long. I had to take her with me to work, you know what I mean?

I: Um hum [positive]

P: And it was just, it's not okay,  it wasn't fair. You know what I mean? Um, so I was like I slept in the room with her. She had her own room and I slept with her in her room and he slept in his room and so we got that distance which he knows is not, I just wasn't feeling like he was doing his part, you know.

I: Um hum [positive].

P And um, so when I got my financial aid, I got me a place of my own with her cause he kicked me and the baby out. He said "Good you got your money, you can move now." And I was like wow, just out of the blue you know so I moved out and um he told my boss that. Well my boss slid me through the paperwork you know what I mean. Cause you're supposed to get it scanned or whatever.

I: Oh yeah.

P: She slid me through because she's been friends with him for 14 years, they both been working there forever and so he told her, "Hey, pull the paper you know and do the scan or whatever because we're not together and duh duh duh" and so she fired me because

I: Oh.

P: I lost my job and I was still doing to Butte College and then uh, one day of the whole year, I''ve raised her for a year, you know what I mean and he had no part in her life, nothing whatsoever um, then he calls me and says,"Can I have her for the weekend?" and I, I didn't want her to be raised without a father or be misled by oh your dad's no good like my mom was with me and my dad was with me so I said, "Okay, you can have her for the weekend." Well that Satur-Suday- that following Monday, that Sunday he didn't bring her home and that Monday I go what is going on so I called him he's all, "I'm bringing her home" well then a sheriff showed up and served me papers, and he had her at this time and uh said that I had to go to court or whatever for custody and um, "What's going on here?" you know so I was trippin', I was like, "Okay, well whatever" so I called him and I'm crying, "What did you do?" He's like, "I just want to make sure both got joint custody you know, I'm not going to take your kid from you, your kid from you. You know I know what you been through with your other kids" cause this man knew everything I been through in my whole life, you know.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: Um and he said he wasn't going to do that do me you know, and he loved me but he just wanted to make sure he wasn't going to get you know, screwed out of the deal. Well, he told me well you just wait for a paper to come in the mail to go to court. No you don't you got 20 days to respond since they served you and I didn't know that. He said, and I trusted him so much that I said, okay. So I waited for a paper to come in the mail. It was like the 25th day I called him I said there's nothing came in the mail and I want my daughter. You know everyday I was callin' can I, can you bring her over, can you bring her over and I'd come take her and you know what I mean and uh that was that.  He never let me take her or nothing so I never got her in my custody and was able to proceed so I waited for that and that nothing showed up and then um I went to the court house and I said, "Check it out. I need to know what the heck to do because my hu-, ex is telling me that you know I have to wait for something to come in the mail. I believed him, you know till now because he's still not doing nothing and I don't see why you guys are takin' so long. Can you guys please tell me when you sent off my forms?" He said ma'am, "You were supposed to be here 20 days or, 4 days ago for your...?" Really? That just shattered me and I mean that right there made me look bad to the courts you know plus I already had cases before with CPS you know what I mean so it doesn't look good. So they already had a negative lookout on me.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: And just, it wasnt fair so.

I: Um, were, when you were in prison where there other women who had similar situations to you that you were able to talk to or what were friendships like?

P: In prison?

I: Um hum [positive].

P: I stuck to myself.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: It was like a rehabilitation place. So it was more like I was doing my work with myself, you know what I mean.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: I was going through a lot of emotional things cause I just, you know and then you give birth and you don't ever want to give up your baby, it's the most beautifulist thing and having to do a lot of that stuff was humbling for me you know. I had to swallow a lot of things I believed in and it was not easy. So I just basically stayed in bed crying or went to my classes that was mandatory. Do what I had to do to see if I could get out if it wasn't too late, you know what I mean. Cause I wanted to get out as soon as possible to get, to try to get my kids, you know what I mean.  I didn't want to prolong no time, get in no trouble, I just wanted to get through this so I could see if there was a chance you know.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: Or repeal my signing or something. Cause I didn't know no laws you know what I mean. I didn't know what you could and could not do and all that so.

I: Um hum [positive].  Um did you, did anyone give you a hard time for it? Staying to yourself? No.

P: No. Not really. CRC's not like a prison prison, it's more like everybody's there trying to get their life together.  You know they want it. Some peoples there just to get out and get out in shorter time or...

I: Um hum [positive].

P:...you know but. I got paroled, no violations, no dirties, no nothings you know cause I was doing so good. It's not like I was just a eff uh eff up you know.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: It's not like that, you know.

I: If you, and I don't think I've ever asked anyone question before. I've done a lot of interviews, not on this project but just interviews in general. If you were to divide up your life into different segments and how you felt about who you were at that particular time. Hod do you think you would divide it up?  I mean could you have like distinct periods where you felt like, this is who you were, this is who I am?

P: Um, I believe, well I was never really myself until now.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: Cause I always had that reservation in my head no matter what because I always picked up. Wether it be that I was clean for five years and then I picked up, you know what I mean. But I always had that reservation in the back of my head. As of today, I don't have that reservation no more. It's not an option in my life and it's not gonna be an option, you know what I mean. I, everyday it's not gonna happen. Period. I just don't do it. I don't have a though and I don't have none of that because I lost so much, like I said, it's not, it's not an option for me, it's not, i am not willing to go through the system again. I'm not willing to lose anything no more, you know I got my family in my life um, I'm working on trying to get my daughter you know, in my life. It's just not an option, you know my boys they got my social security card number and my name in their file so when they turn 18 they'll get their file.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: I mean they know I left a letter in there for them. You know I did all my (Inaudible 0:44:27) work as far as what I could do. Um,

I: Right.

P: in oder to let them know who I am and uh, phone number they'll always be able to contact me when they do turn 18. I don't care 18 years from now or whenever, they will have that there in their file.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: You know what I mean. It's not a number that's going to be shut off you know and stuff like that so they know, they're gonna know, so I, I feel their in a perfect spot where they're at cause they are in good foster homes. They're together. My daughter is perfect where she's at, you know what I mean. It's so, I'm not so much concerned about their well being...

I: Um hum [positive].

P: ...because the system aint gonna put them somewhere in harm. You now what I mean, cause I do trust the system now as of before when the got taken I was like, "Oh no! Someone just wants my kids and their wantin money and all that," you know what I mean.  It's not like that now. Before I would have thought the worst but right now I'm okay with that you with the counseling and stuff I'm doing, I'm okay with where they're at and I know they're gonna contact me.  As with my daughter, my youngest daughter, I know I've got a chance and I'm not gonna let that go.

I: And so, what do you thing? What was the turning point that kind of changed, changed you to have?

P: [Interjecting] How I am now?

I: Yeah. Was..

P: [Interjecting] The turning, well

I: Was there a turning point?

P: It was me accepting that my children were going to find me.

I: Um hum [positive]

P: Me knowing that they're going to, because when they're 18, they gotta be given that file.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: You know what I mean, they have to. When they're 18, they gotta be given that file. When they get that file, my boys knew me that well, I mean they may have been young, but they know me, you know what I mean? It was, it was not something that I know could get out of their heads, you know what I mean?

I: Um hum [positive].

P: I just, I know it and my boys are going to come home and I know that. And I believe God will send them home you know what I mean.  Cause I believe like when you go to heaven you know if you ever have an abortion, stuff like that. God's going to bring all your children, wether there's five babies or one up there and all these angles, they're gonna hand them all to you, you know you, they're yours. And I believe that so, you know what I mean, He's gonna send me back my children, I know he is. And that's what gets me through the day. You know um, but to know that I still have a kid that I could get back is what I think is the whole turning point of me doing what I gotta do, you know.

I: And where were you physically at that time? Like how old were you when you kind of had this idea?

P: Um this is um, well, just recently when I found out that I might have a, I have a chance still to get her back you know...

I: Um hum [positive].

P: ...from her father. He had got a DUI.

I: Umm [positive].

P: Okay. He had her blow through his breathalyzer to start his car and CPS contact me so. So it's all good and I know I'm in now, you know and I'm doing everything I'm supposed to be doing um I will be off this in four months.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: Um, I got a very strong family as far as out of state, you know what I mean. That's willing to find me a house and as long as I do everything right, I've got everything lined up you know what I mean, as far as my child coming home and it's gonna be a home where we can wait for her brothers you know what I mean, sister and it's Gods, God's making things happen in my life that I couldn't do if I wasn't acceptive of all my children. You know what I mean. Cause that's mainly what my who mental and my who emotional using drugs and why I had to use was because I was not okay with how I felt with what I felt I did, my part in them getting taken away. You know what I mean? So,

I: Um hum [positive]. Um does any of this have to do with the program you're in now?

P: Yes. It has a lot to do with it, yeah.

I: How so?

P: Um, they make you do deep like inner healing.

I: Uh huh [positive].

P: From the outside in. But you're doing these steps. One step every two weeks. You know what I mean. You got time to work through the step and they want you to take your time and they got counseling, you know what I mean. They help you, they accept a lot of things that you done and it, you like do the positive and the negative and you weigh them out.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: It makes you look at how was raised but yet, how you're doing things now. You know what I mean.  It does the stages of your life.s

I: Uh huh [positive].

P: And it makes you see that a lot of it aint your fault it's what you believed in your miscommunication you know what I mean, or miss led information I should say.

I: Which is what you started out talking about was misled information from your childhood.

P: Um hum, yeah. Which is how I was raised, yeah. So,

I: Okay.

P: It's actually helping me a lot.

I: Do you um, just in terms of the other people that you're in the program with, do yo see that they're going through similar things? Is it?

P: Yes, yes. Everybody in that program um, whether it be children or, you know or their niece or nephews you know. They go through the same kind of things like their family is just, their niece or nephew and it's just like their kids, you know what I mean. So it's you know, similar stories.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: Um some of them have you know like a lot of deaths because you know, their family members are using, or cause of their using. You know it's different stories but in the end you all got the same result. You know we're in the same position and we're doing the same thing to get back what we lost.

I: Um hum [positive]. Okay, did you um, did you find anything stressful about being a parent?

P: The whole, how you gonna do things on your own, yeah.

I: Yeah.

P: I never got really stressed out with my children. I've always had patience, you know what I mean.  Like when they woke up in the middle of the might I was, I had, I made myself get up and take care of them. It's not stressful. I mean it's stressful when the economy you know the rent and you know things is going up and down, up and down. Um, having a fixed income is very difficult but uh, if you have a job and you know what I mean, it's a lot easier, yeah.

I: Um hum [positive]..

P: It's not something that I'd recommend for anybody that's a single parent. [laughs]. I'd say wait, go to school, get your life together then have kids you know because it's hard, it's hard, but people that do do it, I commend them for it because, you know what I mean cause you know, it's a hard job.

I: Um do you, you know, just because of the type of questions I've been asking you, do you think that there is anything that I should be asking you that I haven't?

P: I'm not sure. I feel like, I feel like relieved like I got a lot of things off my chest already you know what I mean. Cause I tell my, each time I tell my story I feel it's one less thing that I have to go through like that day, like today, like everyday i go through the thought of you know my story or something that's in my story and when I tell my story, it's like okay it's done for the day. You know what I mean? It's like a relieve off me.  Does that make sense?

I: Uh huh [positive].

P: It's like I got it out and I got to tell someone so like it's almost like a counselor you know what I mean. I got to talk about it and it's out of my system for the day and I do it everyday. I got a sponsor I work with uh, everyday I struggle you know. I gotta get up, make myself get up cause physically, I'm not okay.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: Um so I make myself get up, be strong enough to get up and then I gotta strive for you know what I did yesterday that I didn't like or that was not okay as far as sitting with self and  I reflect on that.  Yu know what can I do different today to not have that result today?  And I try to do that every day to where it gets better and better

I: Um hum [positive].  Yeah, talking, I mean telling our stories is, is very...

P: [Interjecting] Yeah it's very emotional but when I cry, 

I: Uh huh [positive]

P: Like after I leave jail if I go home and you know, if I just hug my pillow and cry, but it's cleansing for me you know what I mean.  It's something I need to do, it's something, a process I have to get out because I been holding tears in.  I was taught not to cry, don't show no emotion, you know. So when I got home Ill cry but it will be a good cry, you know what I mean. It'll be something, a feeling within me.

I: I'm glad. I mean I'm glad it is a little helpful...

P: [Interjecting] And it makes me remember what I did wrong in this whole situation and it don't let me forget where I came from, you know what I mean.  So that as far as u, don't forget where you came from, your not better than them.  You're never gonna beat your disease. They don't want you to ever to think you're going to beat it cause no one ever does. You always will have that pleasure in your brain, always there, you know what I mean. Cause you already already woke it up basically, so you can't think you're better than or, you know what I mean.  Or else you'll get twisted in the head and next thing you know, you get something really bad happening you're gonna go out and use because that's what you know. You know what I mean?

I: Uh huh [positive].

P: But if you work every day as uh, in your brain with the little monster, whatever they call them, that's what the doctor said yesterday then you know what, where he will lead you, you know what I mean. You don't forget where you came from as far as you wont go back, you know what I mean.

I: So, the doctor kind of used that language...

P: Yeah.

I:...woke, woke you up or, woke it up and monster...

P: Yeah. It made me see more things, yeah it made me see more things how my brain would work.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: And that was just yesterday I learned that um, it made me see how that, how I would explain that part. You know what I mean? As far as that goes. I knew what would happen like once you use it just progresses, you know what I-once you use it's gonna progress and it keeps doin it and doin it until its got you. But I didn't know how to explain it as far as the doctor did yesterday so it was very helpful, yeah. So,

I: And how about during your pregnancies you, were you, were you using during-?

P: [Interjecting] Oh no, no.

I: Oh. 

P: I was a very health mom. Yeah. My kids were all big. [laughs].

I: Were they? How big were they? You're not that big of a person.

P: My first one was nine pounds.

I: Oh my gosh!

P: And um, they had to cut my, the whole down there.

I: Yeah.

P: And the second one, he was premature, but he was still seven pounds.

I: Oh, yeah.

P: He was three months early.

I: Wow that's yeah. Could you imagine how big..?

P: My daughter she was eight pounds and then my last one she was nine.

I: Yeah.

P: They was all Caesarians after the first one.

I: Oh, okay.

P: Thank god.

I: [Laughs].  Yeah. Well I um, do you have any questions to ask me?

P: No, I just hope it helps somebody, you know what I mean?

I: Um hum [positive]. Yeah uh, I, I think um, I think that's our goal.

P: That's a good thing.

I: Um hum [positive].

P: We need more people out there like that you know, that's trying to help somebody with somebody else's story or wether it's a story or something they've been through or even if it, I don't know, I don't know how to explain it. I just think it's gonna be a good outcome.

I: Okay.

P: I was excited. I went and told my counselor, "They called me!"  She's like, "Okay, calm down."

I: Do you um, I, I was so disorganized when I came over here. 

P: It's okay.

I: No, it really isn't okay I, I don't um, want to, I should have my card. I know I have a card. I don't have a card. I didn't leave you my office number but, I want to give you my office number and if you think of anything that you think I should be talking about, or if you want to have another interview, if you want to talk more, we can do that. [pause] I'm not a very good professor. Here, let me give you my information. Um, [long pause]. So that's um the phone number for our department office...

P: Okay.

I: ...and if, if you want to um, 

P: [interjecting] The interview, whoever you do the interview, or show them whoever and they want more questions or more answers, you can just always call me and we could meet again.

I: Okay alright. And um, yeah, I, I think the um, I think this will be a good thing. And I'm sorry, I, [pause] I really am the absent minded professor. Okay, so, there you go. So I'm going to turn this off now.
